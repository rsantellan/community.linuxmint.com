2mandvd~~~1280586516~~~nixnine~~~4~~~This program works pretty good after you come to understand it's quirky nature.  I really like it.  I compiled it from source, which I recommend as it runs better and has a couple added options.  At time it is prone to crash, but it is a very good dvd maker, with multiple menu options, video background for the menus, chapter creation.  I give it a thumbs up.  The only thing that keeps it from getting a 5 is it's sometimes rebellious attitude.  But all and all, I haven't found anything better and will continue using it.  Just remember:  complie it yourself, and save often.

abiword~~~1270926602~~~Roin~~~4~~~Nice, fast and featurrich Gtk word processor.
abiword~~~1274685265~~~Felagund~~~5~~~Less functions than OpenOffice, but still efficient for simple text processing. It is more lieghtweight than OpenOffice and reads more file formats.
abiword~~~1278539663~~~Xyie~~~4~~~An underappreciated word processing program, Abiword is lighter, and just about as easy to use as OpenOffice's Word Processor, if not moreso. If you like stand-alone applications rather than suites, this is probably the word proccessor you're looking for.
abiword~~~1281909224~~~JasonLG~~~4~~~A good light replacement to OpenOffice for people that don't need all the features of a complete office suite.
abiword~~~1282867524~~~colej84~~~3~~~i like it
abiword~~~1285059709~~~AbeFreeman~~~5~~~OpenOffice does a lot of formatting stuff that I don't want, but can't figure out how to turn off.  Abiword is a much better choice for me.  Setting defaults is much easier as well:  set up a blank document with how you want all the defaults to be, and save it in the templates folder.  Nice.
abiword~~~1286276361~~~ramakantyadav~~~5~~~Great
abiword~~~1316484170~~~ntdevman~~~3~~~Abiword is a simple basic word processor.  I write documents using Abiword almost daily for internal company and personal use, and external publication/presentation documents.
abiword~~~1290786052~~~wanda~~~4~~~Spitze und leicht ,hat aber kein powerpoint presentatie leider leider.
abiword~~~1291966253~~~zolix~~~5~~~Small, fast, easy, cool!
abiword~~~1293324615~~~Shostako~~~4~~~The official word processor of the Gnome project. Really easy, intuituve and good word processor. If you want some easy software too use for your documents, use that.
abiword~~~1294148682~~~Penumbra~~~3~~~Crashes constantly when working on documents not in Abiword format. Development mostly stalled.
abiword~~~1297602393~~~Qruqs~~~1~~~A buggy CPU hog that doesn't yield a single cycle to other processes once it's started loading a file. Painfully aware of this after I tried to open a measly 1.2MB wordlist. 36 hours later, I pulled the plug. Yes, the file system survived.
abiword~~~1301408246~~~Koffeehaus~~~4~~~It certainly looks more appealing than OpenWord, especially on Mint 10 with its Faenza buttons. However I've encountered some rendering problems with .docx format (MSWord2007). .doc and .odt formats seem to work fine.
abiword~~~1311441390~~~Germmare~~~2~~~LibreOffice is now my favorite
abiword~~~1307369132~~~danielcamus~~~5~~~Simple y funcional.
abiword~~~1312788992~~~gianpv~~~5~~~Easy to use and powerfull, it opens .docx too! Best replace for Windows's note
abiword~~~1314504801~~~matrix22~~~4~~~So far so good... It's fast and very easy to use and it support MS word...
abiword~~~1318086884~~~nattyb~~~5~~~Abiword is my favorite word processor.  It has everything I need and more but not too much more.  After Google Chrome and Thunderbird, the first tool out of the box.
abiword-common~~~1271811771~~~maty1206~~~3~~~It is very close to Microsoft Word 2003. Light & easy to use.  The only sin of Abiword is that it doesn't support ODF file format at all.
abiword-common~~~1277047306~~~beansandjeans~~~5~~~Great word processor.  Much lighter weight than OpenOffice.  Especially ideal for those with limited system resources.
abiword-common~~~1277117323~~~CeleronD~~~5~~~fast,light weight and easy to use.
abiword-common~~~1277503178~~~Nottyl~~~2~~~Apparently one cannot change the default font! Either this is true and then it's really bad, or a user can do it, but it's some ridiculously complicated process. Apps shouldn't be like that in this day and age.
abiword-common~~~1286125529~~~aprilland~~~1~~~AbiWord 2.8.2 doesn't allow to edit texts. The key 'Backspace' deletes not only one character but several following words too! Or even the whole paragraph! Never use the version 2.8.2! Try 2.6.8 if you do need this editor.
abiword-common~~~1286892633~~~ntdevman~~~5~~~Abiword is simply a fantastic word processor.  I write documents using Abiword almost daily for internal company and personal use, and external publication/presentation documents.  Abiword has become my "goto" word precessing software.  It provides all the features that are commonly use and makes then easily accessible.  Other reviews have pointed out that it does not have all of the features of OpenOffice, and that is true.  But, even though I have OpenOffice installed I simply always use Abiword for documents. It loads quickly, is stable, and has enough advanced formatting to meet my needs.  I believe that this package will reaily meet the needs of 99% of the people 99.9% of the time.  Personally, I have yet to miss anything. This is a "Must try" word processor
abiword-common~~~1287954160~~~jhpassarelli~~~5~~~WAY better than OpenOffice Writer.
abiword-common~~~1290899619~~~guv999~~~5~~~Great alternative to Open Office writer better desktop intergration
abiword-common~~~1311441445~~~Germmare~~~2~~~Libre Office is now my favorit
abiword-common~~~1314021854~~~mbernardi~~~4~~~Cross platform is helpful, small footprint nice, updates not in LTS repository unfortunate
abiword-common~~~1317573296~~~Anleoje~~~2~~~It have some problems, I prefer LibreOffice
abiword-common~~~1319740455~~~merc1973~~~1~~~Light but complete junk.
abiword-common~~~1320930335~~~IIJETHROII~~~4~~~Good but could be better. I can use it in every day task and it do everything i need.

ace-of-penguins~~~1296002432~~~mca53~~~3~~~I wondered why this was still being offered if it was old and didn't work, so I tried installing it. The games all seem to work for me, but there are no instructions - if you don't know how to play them already you have to figure them out on your own.
ace-of-penguins~~~1296014659~~~e90712~~~4~~~the package here is broken.  I use the one from Debian Sid. Nothing breaks when you use Gdebi to install it when you click on "mirrors" at http://pkgs.org/download/debian-sid/debian-main-i386/ace-of-penguins_1.2-9.1_i386.deb.html.  Thorq is my favorite.  It is the opposite of "freecell".  Play one for a while and then switch to the other to see what I mean.  The function keys bring up the rules, if they are not obvious.

achilles~~~1292140040~~~Shostako~~~2~~~Really, a very strange simulator. The camera moves with the arrows keys and Page Up and Down buttons.
achilles~~~1314004917~~~linux1492~~~3~~~O.k. I believe one can just watch this simulation. Also I found the following explaination what the tool is doing:"Achilles is an evolution simulation based on Larry Yaeger's PolyWorld. It uses Hebbian neural networks, and an extremely simplified physical model that allows virtual organisms to interact freely in a simulated environment.  Achilles was designed and compiled originally on Linux, but it is completely composed of portable C++ code and uses only portable libs such as SDL and OpenGL, therefore it should be trivial to port. All that is needed is hardware to compile on. Any porting efforts that are in progress or successful are welcome to contribute patches back to the main source tree.  What do the colors mean? The organism colors: The brighter red, the more aggressive The brighter blue, the more likely to mate Yellow indicates `dead' organisms, or sources of food  The spikes that flash between the organisms: Red means attack Blue means mate Yellow means feeding  The organisms are given the color of surrounding organisms as an input to the neural network. This emulates 'vision'. Size is an attribute of the genetic algorithms and thus each organism obtains its dimensions from its parents.  Requirements:  · an OpenGL implementation · GLU and GLUT · Simple Directmedia Layer"

acroread~~~1271093644~~~Alexio~~~3~~~Very bloated and seems to eat resources for no real reason. It can offer a nice variety of features for reading, so it's a bit of a trade off.
acroread~~~1271587000~~~distrohopper~~~2~~~With so many free and open source .pdf readers out there, there's really no need for  this. I agree with Alexio, it's unnecessarily bloated.
acroread~~~1271812197~~~maty1206~~~1~~~What's this for? Are you joking me? Seriously, there is no reason for use a PDF destroyer like this.  Close sourced and private software = Monopoly

aisleriot~~~1281814470~~~linux1492~~~2~~~It's only a solitair game. Indeed it does look like a windows game. All that does not make it a bad game. But I do win too often and that is not happening often on my pda or phone. I am afraid it is too easy. What a pitty!

aisleriot~~~1288635132~~~Xyie~~~5~~~This game is more than meets the eye, it's not just Klondike solitare, but almost 100 different solitare games, most of which I don't know how to play, but now I get the chance to learn! This is amazing and fun.

aisleriot~~~1296113420~~~MestreLion~~~5~~~I LOVE it, specially BACKBONE variation! Really addictive! This is NOT like Solitaire: it has more than 80 card games, Solitaire being just ONE of them!

aisleriot~~~1307574386~~~thevaliantx~~~2~~~The game "thirteen" is broken.  The rules are simple, and if one can't win a game after 37 tries then there is definitely a bug in it.
aisleriot~~~1308740850~~~steve470~~~5~~~Lots of solitaire games, decent customization options, pretty good graphics: what's not to like?

alien~~~1282117503~~~Jac978~~~2~~~Although it works very well I also don't suggest to convert packages. It can cause serious problems in your system when a program depends from others. So just carefully.

alpine~~~1305150863~~~Germmare~~~2~~~Thunderbird is what i use
amarok~~~1267886006~~~skeebo~~~5~~~Not too light, but one of the best media players out there. Can be customized well.
amarok~~~1268797140~~~chowanec~~~5~~~I miss 1.4 sometimes, but this is still the best media player available in linux, windows, mac, etc.
amarok~~~1268853207~~~woockash~~~3~~~Not bad, but too slow for me and has too many useless functions
amarok~~~1275399126~~~nikhilsinha~~~4~~~Version 1.4 was the best. There are many problems in 2.3.0 running on Linux Mint 9. Icons are not visible and many problems of amarok with Indicator applet.
amarok~~~1276421451~~~clem~~~5~~~Excellent application, must have if you run KDE.
amarok~~~1273216997~~~VICTOR360~~~5~~~Great  interface,Bookmarks,Great Plugins And Dynamic Playlists Is a Great Music Player

amarok~~~1275526029~~~SeanBest~~~5~~~Sweet player, would be better ink GTK+ :)
amarok~~~1275536733~~~GhoS~~~4~~~Very good player, lots of options. Moodbar though needs to work and needs skinning capabilities
amarok~~~1276907507~~~aneurysm1985~~~2~~~Reviewing version 2.3 - Amarok is a very confusing software program for this ex-Winamp user who likes simplicity. The software seems to come pre-loaded with 'features' that have been merged together without considering the overall look and feel of the software. I am currently using Exaile and find it to have a much superior interface.
amarok~~~1277197630~~~kage~~~5~~~Starts automatically and works all day! My most used app.
amarok~~~1278071243~~~caje~~~5~~~I use it on Kubuntu, there should be something similiar in gtk+

amarok~~~1279464133~~~ivanovnegro~~~3~~~Its not bad but for me its really too slow and its for KDE. I prefer Gnome applications.
amarok~~~1280220827~~~dequire~~~5~~~If you run KDE, this baby is it. The plug-ins are awesome, as are the new automatic Smart Playlists.
amarok~~~1281105357~~~Celtique~~~3~~~Trop de bugs, je regrette la 1.7

amarok~~~1291013580~~~DrMartinus~~~2~~~for me it has become too complex, and some things that I liked about it don't work any more
amarok~~~1292431703~~~Goden~~~3~~~It works, but that's about it. It's quite confusing and it's extremely slow. (gnome)
amarok~~~1294241128~~~Theologian~~~1~~~Very poor: not worth the space.
amarok~~~1294773870~~~jmmzon~~~4~~~It's my favourtie music player but for a few song I preffer QMMP, which is powered by QT too.

amarok~~~1303094884~~~Yuritau~~~2~~~UI far too cluttered.
amarok~~~1304574219~~~slagtra~~~2~~~Would not work under mint 9. Did not find my collection, and would not play it when manually searched for. Crap.
amarok~~~1305735294~~~pfjap-paco~~~4~~~Main audio player.  Interface takes some getting used to, and there's some setup required but after that, it's simply amazing.

ardour-i686~~~1271851711~~~gbrogan~~~4~~~Best Linux DAW. Learning curve is steep. Would like to switch to Ardour full-time, but doesn't yet have the all-in one functionality that I need. MIDI is still developing, some difficulty getting my must-use Vst effects and instruments up and running. A contender for THE breakout Linux audio app. Author works hard at maintaining and developing.
ardour-i686~~~1275336829~~~Wicho~~~3~~~Has a lot of potential but not already!

ario~~~1320958215~~~erapu~~~5~~~Best music player I found on linux. Very similar to foobar. No itunes-like shit, and thats great. Simple & fast.
arista~~~1273547148~~~sayrink~~~5~~~Convenient video recoder, nothing superfluous
arista~~~1280788268~~~amb1402~~~4~~~it is good and need lil improvment

arista~~~1286769608~~~cybertriveni~~~3~~~sometime works sometime not,not so reliable so far
arista~~~1288104749~~~Kitsune22~~~2~~~I tried to use it to encode files playable by the PSP, but it did not work. It looks like it would be a good program, perhaps for other file conversions, however if you are trying convert a video file for playback on a Sony PSP system, this is not where to look.
arista~~~1293161770~~~jahwarrior4179~~~5~~~faster than handbrake
arista~~~1293841442~~~Kupfer~~~5~~~Very easy to use, excellent quality on the output files. After testing alternatives, this is the transcoder of my choice.

arista~~~1298731251~~~Twix2247~~~5~~~Easy to use.  Simple interface, comes with presets for Android and iPhone devices.  Website as list of other presets for other devices, such as Blackberries, as well.
arista~~~1301205651~~~smukhuti~~~4~~~Great!
arista~~~1301717655~~~menta1789~~~5~~~ES MUY BUENO Y NO ME A CAUSADO PLOBLEMAS
arista~~~1315656793~~~Homitsu~~~3~~~It's a good choice for digital video conversion newbies, but has a very poor GUI. If you know how to fine tune it, Handbrake is really better.
arista~~~1316391175~~~henrydubb~~~5~~~Use it all the time. A must have program. Use it to convert wmv, asf, mov to ogg.
ark~~~1275157345~~~AndrewX192~~~4~~~Does what it says, makes managing archive files a snap.
ark~~~1284386572~~~tamoghna4~~~5~~~Works great.
ark~~~1322267012~~~Inoki~~~4~~~It was ok, but nothing compares to Gnome Archive Manager rules.

arora~~~1270919761~~~Roin~~~5~~~Its what it promises, a simple, fast and easy to use Qt-Webkit Browser. Rendering is pretty fast and works mostly without any issues. Though it still isnt perfect I think its just awesome!
arora~~~1274306590~~~stephenmac7~~~5~~~It is the FASTEST WEB BROWSER I have ever seen!
arora~~~1276745671~~~ReckouNT~~~5~~~Best OgenBrowse replacer :D
arora~~~1277669075~~~timocharis~~~4~~~A little raw, but very good.
arora~~~1283523667~~~JumaX9~~~4~~~good browser but it fails at reopening tabs from last time :(
arora~~~1285790136~~~ceptor~~~4~~~dieser browser ist nicht meine erste wahl aber er ist schnell und zeigt die meisten seiten korrekt an
arora~~~1292084808~~~nightwalker~~~4~~~It's simple. Hold it on!
arora~~~1295933649~~~Partizan77~~~4~~~fast&simple;
arora~~~1295947910~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~good.+fast.+simple.+block sites.
arora~~~1296659130~~~Inoki~~~4~~~So far the best Webkit browser out there. Takes advantage of all the features of Webkit, like being super fast and light, combined with efficiency of excellent plugin handling, great AdBlock features, content management and bookmarks. Also, renders webpages quite nicely. The only downside I've found is rendeing of flash videos, which happened to make my computer freeze and on most pages loaded only sound, not video after using the middle mouse button to scroll.
arora~~~1296648892~~~wanda~~~3~~~Nicht mein fall.
arora~~~1298223769~~~Elisa~~~2~~~I've just changed my last review again: after some unexpected crashes, with always no the last session opening tabs, unfortunately I have to say - it sux :-(
arora~~~1296674203~~~romanybob~~~4~~~Reminds me of a young Chrome, but the Adblock actually works properly!! Hooraa. Need's work, a master password etc. but one to watch out for....
arora~~~1307942999~~~smag~~~5~~~I love it
arora~~~1320957988~~~erapu~~~5~~~Best browser for me. If the first you do when installing ff/opera/etc is disabling almost all shit-toolbars out there, then this browser is for you. It has all you need, but no shit you dont need. And it starts extreme fast!
artha~~~1278856875~~~Axilus~~~5~~~saves me a lot of time!
artha~~~1283625760~~~swamiyeswanth~~~5~~~A very good one.. Tonnes of words..
artha~~~1286668647~~~noraelisabeth~~~5~~~Great for learning new words!
artha~~~1288101859~~~Deadite81~~~5~~~Very good!  Has a tray icon and runs in the background.  You can highlight any word in any program, hit the hot key, and up comes the definiton (along with synonyms, derivatives, and much more).

assogiate~~~1306592282~~~MestreLion~~~5~~~Intuitive, solid GUI, great documentation. Great features (lots of options to recognize a file pattern, mime parent and alias, etc). Its one of those must-have tools for configuring and customizing your desktop.. Should be default in any distro
asunder~~~1274337673~~~gunha~~~5~~~Easy to use, yet powerful
asunder~~~1290029862~~~wanda~~~5~~~Powerfull  ,better den Sound juicer.
asunder~~~1294241322~~~Theologian~~~3~~~Good recording features, but useless if it can't find the tracklist, because it's not possible to edit the track titles: needs much improvement.
asunder~~~1304419383~~~k273~~~4~~~More powerful than Sound-Juicer. For those who want more control than simplicity.
asunder~~~1306513063~~~Heep~~~3~~~Better substitue for CDex, but don't have a option for stereo format in MP3. All MP3 are extract in joint stereo.
asunder~~~1307310969~~~jajodo~~~5~~~Uses Freedb.org - finds songs MusicBrainz does not include.   Excellent on its own or complimentary to Sound Juicer.  More options too.
asunder~~~1313711418~~~jvbuxte~~~4~~~Very easy to use!
asunder~~~1317386260~~~linux1492~~~5~~~It rocks 2! People claim it's better then sound-juicer ... can't see the difference yet. But it works after just an installation on the fly. great! love it!

audacious~~~1293545750~~~dhoca73~~~4~~~It remembers me WinAmp, obviously with less options
audacious~~~1293548488~~~bushpilot~~~5~~~The best in sound quality that I have had the pleasure of using in my sound system. I use alsa with Audacious for the best sound. It has better overall sound quality than Windows 7 and J River media that I was using before I went the linux route.

audacious~~~1301207500~~~k273~~~5~~~Love it! Very familiar Winamp interface (can be switched to GTK look), just does what you want, lightweight, and Winamp skinnable. No more those imposing, unintuitive, bloaty audio player for me. My second choice would be Decibel, but I use this more because of its integration with Cairo-dock.

audacious~~~1316499503~~~tacoz~~~5~~~Geez... I recall Wimamp back in the 90s. Audacious is not only as good but better 'cos this is Linux after all... chucked Banshee and Exaile (and they are not bad in any way) for this great small app!
audacious~~~1316621225~~~alexandre-fixe~~~4~~~The best ! It supports gapless playback pretty well.
audacious~~~1316770568~~~conf~~~5~~~everything you want, and nothing you don't!
audacious~~~1317001654~~~Anleoje~~~5~~~The best!
audacious~~~1318296866~~~registereduser~~~3~~~The Equalizer could really be improved. The lowest, 31Hz reall? My headphones go 15Hz and I really like to feel it rumble, so 31hz sounds no good when boosted. Also, what you see in the picture of Software Manager is not what you get. It doesn't come pretty but probably skinable.
audacious~~~1320918249~~~asmarsis~~~4~~~like this app

avant-window-navigator~~~1318674548~~~stleon~~~2~~~good on desktop, not on netbook
avant-window-navigator~~~1319490394~~~ostamb~~~3~~~Had trouble offsetting the dock off the bottom panel, as well as adding windows apps to it  :(

avidemux~~~1304104455~~~angelhjose~~~5~~~Superb!
avidemux~~~1294583072~~~miana~~~2~~~It crashes a lot and often with this message: Segfault  at line 0, file ??ADM_backTrack sig_segfault_handler(int) [0x188400]. When it doesn't crash, it can only convert with incorect frame size. I've tried to choose many options to fix this, but I don't think it works. I just have to move on and find another software out there which are better than this one. Even Any Video Converter (free) in Windows is better than this one.
avidemux~~~1294596268~~~grim~~~4~~~Very good.
avidemux~~~1294597997~~~wanda~~~4~~~Nicht slecht aber ich gebrauche dafur WinFF is einfacher fuer mich.
avidemux~~~1308759691~~~Qruqs~~~2~~~Seems it has issues with some broken .avi's (off a semi-corrupt CD) other programs can read with no problems. But when it works, it works very well. UPDATE: Had to change the "verdict" since I can't get it to create a video file of a certain size. Setting it to 700M gets me an 840M file. That's unwanted behavior.

axel~~~1273253426~~~jesvtm~~~5~~~It's cmd tool, and useful. In some ways, it's better than wget.
axel~~~1303894951~~~thelastblack~~~4~~~thats very quick, i always prefer it to gui ones
axel~~~1304643139~~~princeinflorida~~~5~~~Use with options [n, v, a] for a nice progress display, e.g. "axel -n 4 -v -a url"   Resumes after download interruption.
axel~~~1305150795~~~Germmare~~~2~~~no need for speed ;-)
axel~~~1312425207~~~Zethy~~~5~~~Nice, since some direct downloads have a speed limit,  a program like axel that can open multiple connections at once is a bless. Usage from command line: axel [url]
axel~~~1320955318~~~yggryx~~~5~~~One of the best command-line download accelerators out there.
axel-kapt~~~1304353669~~~princeinflorida~~~1~~~Just use Axel by command line with options n, v, a.

azureus~~~1282328829~~~nolarut~~~4~~~Widely respected in the torrent community however, I prefer to use Deluge.
azureus~~~1284837216~~~metroid_maniac~~~4~~~It's more than just a bittorent client, but if I just want to dl something I use kTorrent

b43-fwcutter~~~1291231105~~~sigmundklaus~~~4~~~What to say? It works! With this Mint distro it took me 2 minuttes to get my wifi up and running.
b43-fwcutter~~~1297530618~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Does a great job at getting some otherwise troublesome wireless cards working easily.
b43-fwcutter~~~1309178247~~~thorneo~~~5~~~This program has like me keep using my old compaq V2000 laptop. The programmer of this wonderfull program should be proud of his/hers work... Thanks so much for this program........
b43-fwcutter~~~1317293706~~~gabak~~~2~~~If you have a wired connection, make sure you have the universe repositories enabled and install synaptic package manager. Once you have synaptic installed search for firmware-b43-installer, right-click to mark it for installation, then click apply. After the packages have downloaded, open the install terminal, and watch to see if the firmware is installed properly. If the firmware installed properly all you should have to do is reboot, and once at the desktop you should have working wireless.
babiloo~~~1322054690~~~linuxali~~~3~~~not bad but golden and xfardic are better
backintime-gnome~~~1275337634~~~m_o_e~~~5~~~mintbackup is cool, but this tool is cooler :-)
backintime-gnome~~~1278264895~~~veng~~~5~~~Totalmente recomendado.
backintime-gnome~~~1279097608~~~Liszt~~~5~~~Excellent backup utility
backintime-gnome~~~1286057138~~~EduardoRT~~~5~~~Excelente!
backintime-gnome~~~1286061249~~~ceptor~~~5~~~schnelles und funktionelles backuptool
backintime-gnome~~~1288101743~~~Deadite81~~~4~~~Good, simple backup tool that allows scheduling.  Recommended!
backintime-gnome~~~1288392338~~~Iwnda0~~~5~~~This tool has saved me many times
backintime-gnome~~~1291669901~~~AlkoLoiK~~~3~~~Snapshots are a good idea and it works just fine. But backintime is too simple and create too many folders. Not my taste...
backintime-gnome~~~1295041656~~~wanda~~~3~~~Mint Backup genugt fur mich bin dar zufrieden uber.
backintime-gnome~~~1295959318~~~efthialex~~~3~~~so and so
backintime-gnome~~~1298113891~~~LinAk~~~4~~~Easy to use
backintime-gnome~~~1302388545~~~guv999~~~5~~~very straight foward and easy
backintime-gnome~~~1305037146~~~marphy~~~5~~~Very good! Has many good features including smart automatic deletion of old backups (which most other tools lack) and is easy to use!
backintime-gnome~~~1305048473~~~trollboy~~~5~~~This is so easy to use that there is no excuse for not taking backups. It doesn't compress the backups but I like that as I can navigate the directory structure if I wish. It uses hard links to present a full directory structure in every backup while only actually copying any changed files. Take a backup every hour. You're worth it!
backintime-gnome~~~1307630535~~~obakfahad~~~5~~~great...
backintime-gnome~~~1314199116~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~Sweet, Great tool to back-up with
backuppc~~~1317066614~~~bblonski~~~5~~~Great home network backup server.  Relatively easy to setup although still probably not for novices.  You'll need to know a bit about rsync/smb/tar.  You can backup windows clients using smb or rsyncd if you install DeltaCopy on the windows client.  However, it's server pull only, no client push.  Great for central backup management, but checkout rdiff-backup if you want single user backups.
bacula-common-sqlite3~~~1290660587~~~J-manning~~~2~~~often confusing results
balder2d-data~~~1305674804~~~aharown07~~~5~~~My son & I enjoy the game often. Simple but alot of fun.
ballz~~~1276702893~~~vipek~~~5~~~Great game! I've spent a couple of sleeples nights because of it :) If you're a fan of arcade games, then you have to play this game :)
balsa~~~1286263687~~~linux01~~~5~~~Nice, lightweight client.
banshee~~~1268240393~~~Mdyter~~~4~~~i hope ,with time , developers will add some more functionality , for example drag and drop add media files in play-list. at least, it has a Delete from Drive option,  for me is very handily. give it a try
banshee~~~1270670551~~~boballen55~~~5~~~Pretty solid media player.  Inegrates podcasts, audio, video and internet radio quite well.  Rips CD's as well.
banshee~~~1274027662~~~caje~~~3~~~Works poor with Last.fm
banshee~~~1274107632~~~white_~~~4~~~Better than Exile and good lookin'. What else need ?
banshee~~~1274131619~~~atlanx~~~5~~~Sehr zu empfehlen.
banshee~~~1274800828~~~farnaby~~~5~~~My choice for GNOME - does everything I need, has a neat user interface and works flawlessly.
banshee~~~1274367200~~~robertochile87~~~5~~~indespensable pero inicio lento en comparacion con rythombox
banshee~~~1274370241~~~CBindahouse~~~4~~~Brilliant app, only problem is a white box round the icon on the notification area. It used to crash a lot in Mint 8 as well.
banshee~~~1274557997~~~kurko~~~5~~~tiene todo lo que necesito. Muy buena aplicación y muy recomendable.
banshee~~~1275171767~~~rappelkiste_src~~~5~~~Ein sehr gutes Abspielprogramm.
banshee~~~1275817706~~~emilioramone~~~5~~~Muy bueno, de los que probe es el que mas se adapta a mis necesidades.
banshee~~~1275856047~~~ohneA~~~5~~~Sehr gutes itunes-Clone.
banshee~~~1277569428~~~huyngochoang~~~5~~~I always play it in the fullscreen mode
banshee~~~1277780896~~~ricardojguzman~~~5~~~love it
banshee~~~1278626492~~~JSB2010~~~5~~~Switched to Banshee from Rhythmbox (after getting fed up with it crashing!).  Banshee is stable and easy to use.
banshee~~~1278800047~~~Twiguard~~~4~~~A great but little-long-loading media player. Lotsa plugins for it out there.
banshee~~~1279422094~~~mtnbiker72~~~5~~~My favorite linux music player, should be the default on Linux Mint as it is far better that Rhythmbox
banshee~~~1279972253~~~ivanovnegro~~~2~~~Too slow for really large libraries and I dont need video function in a music player.
banshee~~~1281231626~~~eth0~~~5~~~its very stable and made på novell , and its the only player which syncs android phones
banshee~~~1283259184~~~JamesHFox~~~3~~~Big, clunky, and requires you to rebuild ipod's library before writing to it?; Rhythmbox does not.  Sticking with the latter
banshee~~~1283501799~~~kameleen~~~3~~~had to switch, because rhythmbox locks up on my pc.  But actually prefer it to this.  Allthough this isn't bad.
banshee~~~1283717205~~~L0r3nz0~~~5~~~The best music player for Gnome
banshee~~~1284035918~~~arztriper~~~5~~~El Amarok de Gnome.
banshee~~~1284724376~~~BAD3R~~~3~~~Banshee
banshee~~~1286264364~~~dme3ha~~~4~~~nice interface, love the integrated podcast directory, from Miro, and cover art auto download
banshee~~~1286442616~~~tamoghna4~~~4~~~Very nice media player. I'de put it next to Amarok.
banshee~~~1286991737~~~frankeinstein~~~5~~~Best music player and library for Gnome. Nice features and plugins. I never use Banshee for video but for music I much prefer it to Rhythmbox.
banshee~~~1288305125~~~i-elf~~~5~~~amarok can finally Exhaust!
banshee~~~1288544797~~~wanda~~~2~~~Zu log und fuer video´s gibt es bessere players und ich mach keine mono.
banshee~~~1288571402~~~dhadaniel~~~5~~~Deberian ponerlo como reproductor por defecto
banshee~~~1296958927~~~jajodo~~~5~~~Has replaced Rhythmbox for me.  V1.8 syncs my Android phone and Rhythmbox does not identify it.  Option to write rating info to the MP3 tag which is nice if your database is lost.
banshee~~~1289635901~~~Dinin~~~3~~~Useful player with many functions and nice interface, but it comsumes a lot of energy, and depends on mono.
banshee~~~1289994877~~~KazuSpara~~~4~~~It should have arrangement of artists as Genre and Album Artist. However the best UI among Linux media plyers.
banshee~~~1290362615~~~mcduarte2000~~~5~~~Clearly better than Rhythmbox!
banshee~~~1290807852~~~Deadite81~~~3~~~I've never had much luck with this one, which is too bad because I would love to have all these freature in one application.  The way I hear people rave about it I feel like it must just be me!  The core function, music management has always worked well for me though.
banshee~~~1290900314~~~guv999~~~3~~~I have tried to like Banshee so much, and can see the potential, but has never been stable enough for me or managed to support my creative zen - would definately give it a go to see how it works out for you though
banshee~~~1291228502~~~Fhernd~~~5~~~Excellent Media Player!!!
banshee~~~1292555530~~~pntp~~~5~~~Rock on! It works perfectly on my creative zen 32G. Goood!!!
banshee~~~1293565149~~~jahwarrior4179~~~5~~~my fave so far
banshee~~~1293567198~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~The more I use it, the more I'm starting to really like it.
banshee~~~1293997883~~~fobenavi~~~4~~~Better than Rhythmbox
banshee~~~1305522227~~~FroyoShark~~~5~~~Best music player, syncs flawlessly with my iPod Touch 2G with iOS 4.2.1
banshee~~~1294383878~~~ludentico~~~4~~~Despite the fact, as most people, that I can't get used to the lack of a genre panel, this is a good music player.
banshee~~~1294388259~~~xcbiker~~~5~~~Banshee is a fully featured multimedia library manager with some nice additions (e.g. sound equalizer, cover management) and integration with brasero for easier cd creation. Vast catalogue of plugins from community and developers to manage playlists and external devices. One of the best player around, although still a little slow when loading very big libraries on average pc.
banshee~~~1294388822~~~OldMarcus~~~5~~~A very good, full featured media player, with good library management features and integration with online services, such as last.fm. For me, the fact that it depends on mono is irrelevant, and shouldnt be relevant to any new Linux user either.
banshee~~~1294767003~~~RobLoach~~~5~~~Way better than Rhythmbox.
banshee~~~1294946476~~~grim~~~4~~~I like it, but i prefer Rhythmbox :D
banshee~~~1295005860~~~jflarm~~~5~~~Love Banshee, easy to use and a ton of features
banshee~~~1295318770~~~avetik~~~1~~~Horrible!.. Rhythmbox is 100% better!
banshee~~~1295506100~~~farocker~~~5~~~Works great !
banshee~~~1296281466~~~nikhilsinha~~~4~~~It has all the capabilities to become the best audio player in linux.
banshee~~~1296349362~~~Sol_Badguy~~~4~~~Good :)
banshee~~~1296634330~~~lorenzo6596~~~5~~~Easy to manage and simple to use!
banshee~~~1299741936~~~Townley89~~~5~~~Love it! Better than rhythmbox and becoming default anyway
banshee~~~1298673713~~~grwebguy~~~4~~~Smooth, Amazon % goes back to Gnome
banshee~~~1298993384~~~joelburge~~~3~~~I love the functionality and just the app overall. The problem - performance can be randomly sucked into a black hole. This seems to be a known issue. Bummer.
banshee~~~1299577895~~~ravenous-dark~~~5~~~Of all the linux music players I've tried, this one works best for me. I would highly recommend.
banshee~~~1300196056~~~k273~~~4~~~The best right now. Works very smoothly for playing music. Do almost everything the way I want. More powerful than Rhythmbox, no confusing menus (gmusicbrowser) and others' general unintuitiveness, and no bugs with playlists and recognizing audio CDs (Exaile).
banshee~~~1300396409~~~Somnium~~~4~~~Performance can sometimes get laggy, but on the whole is very good. Functionality and features make this a definite keeper.
banshee~~~1300978752~~~jay4rest~~~4~~~It is one of the best and is better than Rhythmbox, in my opinion at least.
banshee~~~1300990449~~~Nimmo~~~4~~~I tried Rythmbox for a while, but much prefer Banshee's look and feel.
banshee~~~1301159454~~~Proggg~~~4~~~Thx Jesus! One good media player on linux! xD
banshee~~~1302380804~~~der_alex~~~5~~~Since version 1.8 banshee has become my favourate music player
banshee~~~1302479625~~~dardevelin~~~4~~~very cool software, smillar to Rhythem but with better sound
banshee~~~1302626325~~~terces~~~5~~~Best player for linux.
banshee~~~1302875262~~~rodrigo_uruguay~~~5~~~It become my only choice when reproducing music.
banshee~~~1303250592~~~jesterofalltrades~~~3~~~This is a very polished media application, but it depends on mono, which is not a long-term solution.. We need to move away from mono. Read more here: http://techrights.org/2009/06/02/mono-an-infectious-disease/
banshee~~~1303368205~~~Fastraxx~~~5~~~Very good, works great for syncing my ipod classic 160gb.
banshee~~~1303805792~~~Hil002~~~5~~~Mejor reproductor de musica para Linux
banshee~~~1303977900~~~bAPTIST~~~4~~~Good player. With the search function on the data conn playing track in Wikipedia and on Youtube.
banshee~~~1304026303~~~Ciprian~~~3~~~From my oppinion is just too big, too slow... For just a music player I think is too much... Anyway, on a netbook is just too slow. I install it, try it, and remove it. Good luck ppl.

banshee~~~1305757894~~~bulmaro90~~~4~~~me gusta por que administra mi biblioteca de musica y videos, lo malo es que aun no reproduce videos .rmvb
banshee~~~1306500628~~~Elyste-217FR~~~5~~~le meilleurs
banshee~~~1306530836~~~linuxfanatik~~~5~~~Banshee (or the Celtic version Bansidhe) is a very good Music Management program. It beats Rhythmnbox and has some elements that go far beyond Amarok for musical power and catalogueing. You won't go far wrong with Banshee!
banshee~~~1306551252~~~wrchiu~~~3~~~how to close banshee at linux mint 11?
banshee~~~1306603775~~~mitanshugamer~~~4~~~great..
banshee~~~1306630367~~~vendettaboom~~~5~~~Muy buen programa
banshee~~~1306696879~~~nlsthzn~~~4~~~A no nonsense music player, growing from strenght to strenght with each release I am happy to use it as my defualt music manager and player.
banshee~~~1306838191~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~4~~~good app for organising and playing music
banshee~~~1307281877~~~Althorion~~~4~~~Great for organising music, excellent player. Unfortunatelly, it requires Mono.
banshee~~~1307470510~~~client26~~~4~~~well done
banshee~~~1307992208~~~a-woozy-fieldmouse~~~5~~~My two reasons for loving Banshee: 1) I can edit my music files' (not just aliases of them) ID3 tags in the player and 2) it supports sorting by the "Composer" tag.
banshee~~~1307998990~~~netean~~~3~~~it's ok for music, but IME, slow for syncing with iPod Touch/iPhone and podcast support is not nearly as good, usable, fast or intuitive as other applications. Rhythmbox handles both of these better (and a lot quicker)
banshee~~~1308519117~~~UncleNinja~~~1~~~mono
banshee~~~1308681759~~~flan_suse~~~5~~~Prefer this to Amarok and RhythmBox. Clean, functional, active developers; professional quality.
banshee~~~1309231041~~~chillgates~~~4~~~banshee is good
banshee~~~1309368471~~~DaemonKazoom~~~2~~~I'ts not bad but can break a your collections and make a big mess.
banshee~~~1309760983~~~trollboy~~~1~~~It's better than Rhythmbox in functionality but is a Mono application
banshee~~~1309764530~~~Elisa~~~3~~~Not bad but IMHO, mplayer-nogui ran in CLI is cool and effective! :)
banshee~~~1310278791~~~Bocardi~~~1~~~Navigating the GUI was painfully slow with a large music collection
banshee~~~1311079594~~~minorthreat~~~3~~~not bad but its not better than amarok and clementine
banshee~~~1311224969~~~ali20~~~4~~~i test it.it works well.but isnt very beautiful
banshee~~~1311601062~~~pcwiz13~~~2~~~Not the worst but I think that Rhythmbox is much better. It's not as stable as Rhythmbox.
banshee~~~1312032832~~~linuxpenguin~~~5~~~Great player, better than Rhytmbox and Exaile, great interface and fully functional. I don t have any problems while using this player
banshee~~~1312227630~~~barburo~~~1~~~Only plays 1/3 of my mp3 tracks (cos of Mono and OMA) so a  huge turn off for those with mature mp3 collections. btw Gnome Mplayer plays all mp3s no problem
banshee~~~1313176307~~~Labby~~~5~~~Love it! I tend to watch a lot of video podcasts, and the ability to play them in fullscreen and still have access to the playback controls by simply moving the mouse, is a win in my books. So much better than Rhythmbox in that regard!
banshee~~~1314117563~~~nipu011~~~5~~~best music player i've seen ....for linux
banshee~~~1313235384~~~crom~~~2~~~I hate programs which try to be jack of all trades. Try Deadbeef if you want to play music. Just add the deadbeef ppa repository.
banshee~~~1318971024~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~works well
banshee~~~1314100524~~~mparfitt~~~4~~~Far better than Rhythmbox
banshee~~~1314333435~~~kimmynz~~~3~~~The lack of support for subscribing to password protected podcasts is pushing me back to Rhythmbox. Nice media player otherwise.
banshee~~~1314621689~~~MajorGrubert~~~3~~~N'atteint pas souvent le scan de ma bibliothèque sans planter, sinon pas mal mais bon...
banshee~~~1315436039~~~toto_de_France~~~3~~~pas mieux que rhythmbox
banshee~~~1315751121~~~Rufus~~~4~~~Good music player, good for importing cds as mp3 files. But automatic recognition of artist, album and tracks does not always work.
banshee~~~1315927143~~~Twamgrui~~~5~~~??????
banshee~~~1316810054~~~lm4td~~~4~~~Simple and easy to use
banshee~~~1316992432~~~Anleoje~~~5~~~Great music player!
banshee~~~1318572386~~~rolfogodoy~~~5~~~nice and easy to use
banshee~~~1318746223~~~Squirrel~~~5~~~This indexes ALL your media files, not just your mp3s. We're talking downloaded youtube videos, m4a, flv, and avi. It's easier than ever to make automatic playlists with this. It also includes all the same features as a standard player, like radio, scrobbling, and linking to other music sources. It even runs on windews!

banshee-extension-mirage~~~1295831415~~~mpkingsley~~~4~~~One of the plugins for banshee that I use the most;  Its like the genius Mixes on iTunes, but based on your song's musical similarity, not genre or artist.
banshee-extension-mirage~~~1308078992~~~ray1claw~~~5~~~i use it all the time!

bareftp~~~1299865797~~~Don_Alfonso~~~3~~~no drag and drop
basenji~~~1312547653~~~OttifantSir~~~4~~~Best removable-media indexing tool I have used. The cons are few with this. GUI could've been more polished, and when adding new entries, it should start counting at the first unused number. As it is now, if you've deleted entry 1, the next entry defaults to 2 regardless. Minor annoyances that's all.
bash~~~1305524109~~~bananas4370~~~5~~~I work a lot on the command line, and BASH is my favourite shell
bash~~~1306533228~~~linuxfanatik~~~5~~~Like it said Awesome. I started off on UNix then moved to SUSE 6.1 and moved up to SUSE Professional 8.2 (prior to the take-over by Novell). In all that time I used mostly text commands. But when I switched to Ubuntu 6.6 it was fun to use the mouse too though Bash was quicker (like Liquor) ;)!
bash-completion~~~1305244808~~~bananas4370~~~5~~~Makes the command line fun to use
bashare~~~1284313406~~~5_O_Clock_Charlie~~~5~~~Great program !! Easily send or receive any size file directly to or from anyone over the net, regardless of their OS. Just send them the link !! NOTE: it did require the installation of Miniupnpc and Libminiupnpc to get past my router (links on the homepage).
bashare~~~1295386833~~~kip-~~~5~~~man this program is so handy! specialy on irc to share some stuff with mates on another side of world.. for me is must have program!

bb~~~1286678517~~~tpapastylianou~~~5~~~Not really a game, and quite an old demo, but a very cool demo nonetheless. It's easy to forget you're just watching a bunch of symbols on the screen after a while! If you thought the matrix screensaver looks cool, wait till you check this out!

beagle~~~1279231781~~~Teucca~~~4~~~Tiedostojen hakukone, hakee jopa sanoja asiakirjoista.
beagle~~~1289182154~~~Squirrel~~~5~~~This has saved me much time at work, like when I needed to find that pesky presentation from several years ago, or needed bring up a data-sheet quickly.
beast~~~1284790124~~~David_Frost~~~3~~~I love this program. It is simular to a program i used to use in Windows called "synth maker," but this is much easier and more fun to use. The graphics are great for this kind of software (they are always stripped down and pretty straight forward, this one tries though). This progam comes with a few premade synths already on it, and then you can also download more on the net site for the program. I definitly give it two big thumbs up
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1272465665~~~Alexio~~~4~~~The graphics are a bit dated, but the storyline is excellent. If you enjoyed games like Monkey Island, King Quest and Quest for Glory, you will love this one.
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1275049070~~~rosendir~~~5~~~Really recommended if you like point and klick adventure from mid 90's. I played it when it was new but it's still Awesome!
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1277043568~~~asymmetros~~~5~~~I remember this game since 90s. I have played some games since then, but this remains as one of my favorites. Exciting plot, nice humour too.
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1283618310~~~flor_de_azucena~~~5~~~I am a fan.
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1285734576~~~xenogia~~~5~~~Classic adventure game that has aged gracefully.  Truly recommended if you enjoy this genre.
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1291315608~~~d00med~~~5~~~One of the greatest games ever. The voice audio pack is a must to fully appreciate the humor
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1292529407~~~mockturtl~~~4~~~see also: flight-of-the-amazon-queen
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1295190672~~~Jac978~~~4~~~A good old game.
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1298939486~~~Draco~~~5~~~I liked this game. Good graphics & animation. Great English voices!!! Good story too. Like to see more of these type of games on Linux Mint :)
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1301881386~~~python~~~5~~~great game. A good example of whats really necessary for a game to be fun and engaging (story, humour, etc ...) modern 3D graphics not required :)
beneath-a-steel-sky~~~1304858887~~~ashtoash~~~5~~~Good Game is a good story, not graphics

bibletime~~~1305366827~~~tecumseh99~~~5~~~BibleTime is a simple Bible software
bibletime~~~1320108336~~~chassum~~~4~~~You can run it in Gnome, but you will want to make sure that libqt4-svg is installed, or you will find some of the icons missing.
bibus~~~1280767333~~~ivanovnegro~~~2~~~Its not the best out there. I prefer zotero within Firefox. I think Bibus needs more features for me to work seriously with it.

blender~~~1275429467~~~wolfprint~~~5~~~Nothing compares to this program in my opinion for the price. The next release 2.5 will be even better. The Alpha and even more so the up-to-date custom builds from users and developers rock.
blender~~~1275852915~~~Rovanion~~~5~~~The best there is
blender~~~1277983412~~~R-lee~~~5~~~Best open source 3D-content-creation-suite, contains also a 3D-GameEngine

blender~~~1285448247~~~ffabris~~~4~~~The UI is horrific! But still an amazing piece of software.
blender~~~1286990732~~~frankeinstein~~~5~~~Great program although the interface is quite ugly. You need Blender 2.5 for Openshot 3D titles etc.
blender~~~1290686202~~~Boringbytes~~~5~~~Excellent! Yes, Learning any 3d software is going to take time and effort, and that's true of  Blender too. For some help getting started check out the links to learning and educational resources on the website at Blender.org.
blender~~~1288214861~~~30ctsparer~~~4~~~Nice 3D tool. A little more usability would be good.
blender~~~1289871896~~~zaenal1234~~~5~~~great...!!!

blender~~~1290648608~~~squirrel-the-tire~~~5~~~Probably the best open-source software I've run into except for linux itself! If only ATI would support my older card better in linux.

blender~~~1295925212~~~houn~~~4~~~when do is it available in the repos, the version 2.5 or higher
blender~~~1298139454~~~xcausex~~~5~~~The only thing better than Blender 2.49, is the newer Blender 2.5 series! I've used a lot of other professional packages, including Maya and 3DS Max, and I couldn't dream of ever wanting to go back to them since I've found Blender.
blender~~~1298161733~~~sonic4spuds~~~3~~~This is my review untill the 2.5x version is available in the repos. As fot the films they aren't verry impressive, esspecially Sintel, as they had an enoumous buget for the poor quality they produced, regardless of the openess of the software.

blender~~~1310133057~~~neurone-mint~~~2~~~very difficult to use
blender~~~1310320485~~~lourdchien~~~4~~~Took 6 months to get used to it, but you can create and render wonderful scenes with it. Get the 2.5+ version for a better interface.
blender~~~1311449017~~~stanlee~~~5~~~Great 3D software,but why not 2.5?
blender~~~1311809910~~~mintlinux~~~5~~~Great 3D modeller, but this should be 2.5 not 2.49

bluefish~~~1274279530~~~sojabob~~~5~~~Bluefish is an easy to use and simple editor with configurable syntax highlighting for different doctypes. It offers a lot of useful features, such as thumbnail creation, easy wizards for starting a project and so on. Not only for experienced users, this nice program makes editing xhtml, css or any other textbased documents easy and clear.  Tabs for several opened documents, bookmarks and an easy navigation window make working more convenient. Bluefish can store project files, lets you display your documents in different browsers and validates your code (via aditional packages).

bouml~~~1274276206~~~alaak~~~4~~~Best free UML Editor. Even supports templates at most elements from UML 2.0. Code generation for more then only java. :) Is a little complex but very reliable if you know how. Not as good with round trip engineering as commercial tools like together. But since it is C++ based it is usable even on slow computers (worked on 800 MHz stone age machine at university).
bouml~~~1277896314~~~foxpacific~~~5~~~The only free UML modeler that allows me to both forward AND REVERSE engineer code to model.  Well done!!!!

cairo-dock~~~1283555555~~~Zethy~~~4~~~After using this dock for about 6 months I can say I understand most of the options and configurations. Without any doubt, this is the most beautiful dock that you can find and the most customizable. However, I don't give it 5 stars because til version 2.1.3 presents compatibility problems with VLC and unselects windows when move between desktops. If there is a work around for this, I couldn't find it. It is a great dock overall.

cairo-dock~~~1319935330~~~W4RP1G~~~3~~~The OpenGL version ran slow and eventually crashed even though I have an Nvidia ION gpu with the latest driver.  The non OpenGL version works fine, but I prefer a Mac-like toolbar at the top, and Docky for a minimalist dock.
cairo-dock~~~1320589233~~~cirx~~~2~~~Glitzy plaything, far from elegant. Configurable in many aspects, but not where I need it. Takes too much time to figure out a decent layout, templates are ugly, too. Cannot uninstall the first/main dock and create another one ins its place when I want to, must rather choose new theme and start from scratch.. Have to stick with Docky. Even awn is more tolerable than cairo.

Gonna try to get a grip on several 1000 scientific papers in my data-base with this tool. Then again. One might want to know how that is possible with this tool. Would need a ctrl-A ... import ... covert ... AND don't re-write the stuff and waste lots of disc space ... lets see if it does that. If so I might want to write a tutorial ...
calibre~~~1320473651~~~merelyjim~~~5~~~Used Calibre to augment the e-book selection for my Nook color, but find it's easier to just use my netbook running Calibre as an e-reader.

canorus~~~1294503269~~~Silent_Warrior~~~3~~~In its present state, I feel it's missing a number of features Denemo covers. The only real reason I can see right now to use Canorus over Denemo is the friendlier interface.
carmetal~~~1317077543~~~Anleoje~~~4~~~Good geometric program
castle-combat~~~1273621461~~~dim3000~~~4~~~Interesting Game, fun to pass time
castle-combat~~~1298842236~~~lobo32~~~2~~~did't work
catfish~~~1280559680~~~patriki~~~5~~~Great & fast search tool.
catfish~~~1282729026~~~robertofmj~~~5~~~Similar to windows find programs. But more complete and fast, remember Mint users have the powerful ext4 system.
catfish~~~1294148886~~~Penumbra~~~2~~~Very primitive, has annoying bugs; abandoned.
catfish~~~1294689194~~~hexram~~~4~~~GUI for find, locate and others
catfish~~~1295984263~~~efthialex~~~4~~~(y)
cbrpager~~~1316015367~~~gadgetboi~~~5~~~Works better than qcomic! awsome
cdcat~~~1295087854~~~Qruqs~~~2~~~Albeit being a very good app at searching (with a few bugs aside), this app lacks stability so you're at risk of corrupting your xml database. Has happened to me, after about 800 CD's entered. If the app encounters an error, it simply shuts down with no warning. For this, I cannot give it more than a 2. Works okay for _small_ catalogs, but the huge ones I'm accustomed to (+1,200 CD's, and counting), no way! There is also a bug in the installer which makes it a no-show in the Menu on my Swedish system, you need to run it using "Run".
cdi2iso~~~1278774501~~~xtrekkiee~~~4~~~Very good and well designed tool!
cdi2iso~~~1317940965~~~eduardo~~~2~~~no le entendi
cdlabelgen~~~1297335941~~~kip-~~~5~~~hell yeah! thank you!
cdpr~~~1319230636~~~LimesX~~~5~~~Very handy tool, if you need to identify a Cisco switch port of a cable hanging around in one of the data centre's rack. After 60 seconds it gives you the device name, device type, device ip address and port you are connected to.
cdrdao~~~1312206986~~~robertb~~~4~~~Since wodim had troubles blanking DVDs, this works well to blank them.
ceferino~~~1284046648~~~shwany~~~4~~~simple, but entertaining
ceferino~~~1287751249~~~strider~~~4~~~Being a massive fan of 'Super Pang' when I was younger, I was quite keen to play this. It's very simple, but retains the playability of the original Pang. Fans of the original game will enjoy this. Nice work, thanks..
celestia~~~1271086030~~~Alexio~~~5~~~Outstanding educational tool for astronomy and astrophysics. Good scripting language for automation; extendable and genuinely entertaining.
celestia~~~1273220614~~~iceblade~~~5~~~fantastic software that is very expandable and informative. you'll learn things about the solar system you never knew. a must have
celestia~~~1282641357~~~Bogeyman~~~5~~~I love space and stuff and this is a brilloiant tool for the kind of stuff I do.
celestia~~~1282662000~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Always loved this program! But since I've switched to Mint, I can't get the GTK version (which I prefer) to run. The KDE version works well enough, though.
celestia~~~1291314923~~~guv999~~~4~~~Good stuff!
celestia~~~1292622925~~~JarlArntzen~~~3~~~It's pretty good but why do the bookmarked locations start zoomed so far out? When selecting earth, you have to zoom in more than 20 AUs (lots of mousewheel scrolling). Didn't this also have decent textures for the various planets as well as a nice Gnome UI?
celestia~~~1314395146~~~cobra243~~~5~~~nice work, keep it up
celestia-gnome~~~1277534135~~~mikefreeman~~~1~~~This does not work for me. When run, it simply freezes until I force it to quit. Terminal output gives no indication that there is a problem. I have to use the KDE version instead, although I would rather have a Gnome-based version..
celestia-gnome~~~1289333675~~~hewhowatches~~~5~~~Highly recommended. I also had problems loading initially - this was resolved by installing the package libgl1-mesa-dri to enable OpenGL system wide.
celestia-gnome~~~1296853847~~~josevegacastro~~~5~~~Siempre me gusto este programa, viajar por el espacio y utilizar scripts para visualizar animaciones es lo mejor, muy educativo.
celestia-gnome~~~1301046102~~~Topen~~~5~~~Wow, simply amazing! you can easily lose an entire afternoon in this virtual universe!
celestia-gnome~~~1314485385~~~Decaffienated~~~5~~~I have used this program in Ubuntu 10.4 - 11.04 and found it to be VERY educational, as well as entertaining (I agree with Topen on this). The ability to see objects in three dimensions really makes the relative sizes and distances obvious!
celestia-gnome~~~1317400312~~~HowlinNate~~~5~~~A beautiful, educational application. If you've ever wondered what Warp 9.9 felt like, use this.
cellwriter~~~1295543612~~~Sketch~~~5~~~really useful for tablet laptop users
cellwriter~~~1308197849~~~Agent9~~~5~~~This is a great and well featured program. If you use a Tablet PC, theis is a MUST HAVE
celtx~~~1280807684~~~loki~~~4~~~Great piece of screenwriting software
celtx~~~1285044332~~~stlshawn~~~4~~~I use this quite a bit. This is one of those key software packages that i require to make the transition to full linux.
centerim~~~1274937505~~~rexc~~~4~~~This is  commandline IM client. This isn't for everyone but I use when I don't want too much of GUI in the way. Some of the keyboard shortcuts don't make sense but you can rebind them with some difficulty. All up, good for the power user to run in a ssh session perhaps.
centerim~~~1280179619~~~robertofmj~~~5~~~Love it ! Command line msn client. Very simple, light and nostalgic !
centerim-utf8~~~1281469957~~~robertofmj~~~5~~~If youre brazilian, germany this version support all special buttons of keyboard.
cgmail~~~1308065091~~~AnSnarkista~~~5~~~Ni Thunderbird, ni Evolution, Cgmail + prism-google-mail (o prism en su defecto)
cgoban~~~1289839414~~~farnaby~~~4~~~Good goban, but better use the latest version from the kgs website.
checkgmail~~~1268009931~~~conquerortim~~~5~~~The best mail checker I have ever used. could be made to integrate better with with gnome or Xfce.
checkgmail~~~1270871116~~~NineDegrees~~~4~~~Excellent as long as you dont get too many emails.  It can be overloaded easily.
checkgmail~~~1274113418~~~vadi01~~~5~~~really cool and addictive. Stays nicely and elegantly in the system tray and has a small pop up menu when mail comes in. Shows you a preview of the new mail. Highly recommended for those gmail addicts.
checkgmail~~~1274413282~~~cardinal4~~~4~~~The interface interactivity is not well-designed, you might accidentally open tons of Gmail windows while trying to read. It is the most full-featured one available though.
checkgmail~~~1282577559~~~French~~~5~~~fast,easy handsome
checkgmail~~~1283544379~~~Frezi~~~5~~~J'en suis enchanté, reglé pour démarer au lancement de ma mint, il fonctionne très bien. Un bon notificateur surtout que gmail offre maintenant la possibilité de réceptioner le courrier d'autre adresse ce qui fait que tout peut fait pas gmail et signalé par ce petit notificateur
checkgmail~~~1290693826~~~shaon121~~~5~~~Gmail rocks
checkgmail~~~1287317151~~~Manx~~~4~~~I like it. Especially if you install the prism google mail program too. Then in the settings fill out prism-google-mail as browser. It will bring you directly to the inbox without the need to write username/password.
checkgmail~~~1288514221~~~riki~~~2~~~No good for multiple accounts!
checkgmail~~~1289559581~~~paulasimoes~~~5~~~Best of this tool is the ability to Mark as read, Archive, Report Spam or delete without having to open the browser
checkgmail~~~1295591883~~~simmy~~~3~~~transparency issues in some themes (as with many gnome apps sadly (cpu temp/gcheck mail, ubuntues notification applet etc) works but ugly in some themes as i couldnt seem to get the background tray color to work at all
checkgmail~~~1295592829~~~Elisa~~~3~~~No big deal...
checkgmail~~~1296104858~~~MestreLion~~~2~~~It works, but lots of issues: always ask for pwd when opening browser, 404 when i glick on email subject, doest work with Goggle Apps accounts, sometimes lists shows in wrong place. Ill look for an alternative.
checkgmail~~~1307980966~~~alfasierra~~~4~~~funciona muy bien, como visor de correos nuevos
checkgmail~~~1317807096~~~nessim~~~3~~~Dont have any sound notification! Should be impoved regarding that feature!
checkgmail~~~1318456288~~~mchenier~~~1~~~Fonctionne pas quand le compte gmail est protégé
checkinstall~~~1271261933~~~Alexio~~~4~~~Useful when you want to install a program from source code, but especially when it comes to upgrading or uninstalling that program.
checkinstall~~~1291537346~~~shaon121~~~4~~~good
checkinstall~~~1294474733~~~hellangel~~~4~~~ok
checkinstall~~~1303981683~~~omena~~~5~~~good
checkinstall~~~1306665887~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~5~~~allows you to build .deb packages from source code so you can share them and remove them using a gui package manager

chillispot~~~1300932243~~~miana~~~1~~~Chillispot doesn't show up in my laptop, and I cannot find Chillispot anywhere in my laptop. It doesn't show up after I restarted laptop either. So I think this app is useless.
chkconfig~~~1280491379~~~elscripto~~~3~~~Semi-useful at latest distro releases, as it fails to detect the system services moved to upstart paradigm

chmsee~~~1304835548~~~anatolik2008~~~5~~~The best chm viewer for Linux
chmsee~~~1305496013~~~unexistance~~~5~~~Should be installed by default
choqok~~~1282999931~~~dequire~~~5~~~KDE Twitter and Identica client that's simply the best if you're running KDE. Nice community, too.
choqok~~~1284090325~~~olujicz~~~5~~~The best microblog client for linux.
choqok~~~1285875313~~~ffabris~~~5~~~Excellent Twitter client, multiple accounts supported. Glad I found this!

choqok~~~1315241309~~~mediastupor~~~2~~~Wouldn't launch in Mint 11 LXDE, presumably because it lacked KDE dependcies.
chromium-browser~~~1268005381~~~conquerortim~~~4~~~works and looks great after you change the theme to gtk and set normal window borders in the options.
chromium-browser~~~1268178021~~~ggolemg~~~4~~~almost perfect, and now better than firefox
chromium-browser~~~1268227096~~~woockash~~~2~~~Firefox is still better. For me chrome isn't yet stable. Flash player causes the crashes of whole browser and sometimes there is some problem with opening PDF document. Maybe someday I'll try it again...
chromium-browser~~~1268527335~~~bjasto~~~4~~~Very fast. Good options.
chromium-browser~~~1269498956~~~relst~~~3~~~Its fast at the start, but when you have over 50 tabs open it gets slow... And I miss alot of my firefox addons...
chromium-browser~~~1269679480~~~Vincent~~~5~~~A simplistic and minimalistic browser that I use for my day-to-day browsing. Definitely feels faster than Firefox, especially when it comes to dealing with Javascript and more multimedia intense websites. I never really relied on Firefox-specific addons and I use Privoxy to filter ads, so Chromium contains enough functionality for me and is a pleasant experience to browse with.
chromium-browser~~~1270871014~~~NineDegrees~~~1~~~Same as Opera, doesnt work with 85% of websites I visit.  Speed is overrated, its worthless.
chromium-browser~~~1271079899~~~KittyKatt~~~5~~~My browser of choice. Lightweight and functional. Has multiple extensions (not as many as FireFox, but some very useful ones) and a few themes. Worth the time to try it.
chromium-browser~~~1271117056~~~ArcherSeven~~~5~~~See KittyKatt.   Also uses screen-estate better and looks nicer.
chromium-browser~~~1271129566~~~jkw~~~5~~~Lightweight, Fast and Modern. Sync bookmarks with my Gmail account (Google Docs) on all computers I use it on. I have replaced Firefox a long time ago with it.
chromium-browser~~~1271207239~~~crondon~~~5~~~Switched from Firefox about a year ago and never looked back. Faster, nicer to look at, more functionality sans add-ons. Great browser.
chromium-browser~~~1271314178~~~peramak~~~5~~~simple,light,fast.
chromium-browser~~~1271346743~~~Rufus~~~3~~~Good for netbooks because it fits on small screens and is fast. But compatibility for plug-ins like Flash is not good. Didn't display YouTube videos for example.
chromium-browser~~~1271357157~~~captainhaggy~~~5~~~Der Browser ist schnell, unglaublich aufrüstbar, so wie der Firefox .. aber eben ... schnell. Man muß etwas mit dem Datenschutz aufpassen. Die aktuellesten Version schlagen sich besonders gut im HTML5-Test. Auf meine Netbook läuft es exzellent, Java, Videos, YouTube, alles kein Problem.
chromium-browser~~~1271376178~~~Taliesen~~~5~~~Wonderful in Linux, I like it more than firefox which is saying something.
chromium-browser~~~1271381064~~~verkaro~~~5~~~will convert completely once rss reading and a few bugs are fixed
chromium-browser~~~1271592904~~~MintHat~~~3~~~It's got potential for a 5 star rating, It doesn't feel right for me
chromium-browser~~~1271816069~~~maty1206~~~4~~~This is the reason why I love Google. A very light impressive web browser, easy-to-use.  My second favorite app for surfing the web.
chromium-browser~~~1274296092~~~CBindahouse~~~3~~~Fast. Still some bugs, though. Not as customizable as Firefox, yet, though surely reading webpages is more important than what your browser looks like...
chromium-browser~~~1272213580~~~SeanBest~~~4~~~Like the browser. Needs some good adblocking though. It can block some ads, but not before it actually lods them unlike Firefox that completely ignores them. Also can't click-scroll with the middle mouse yet in the Linux variant of Chrome.
chromium-browser~~~1272216649~~~newhanoian~~~5~~~been using it from ppa repo for a few month, much better than firefox

chromium-browser~~~1273009965~~~jatwood~~~4~~~Chrome is fast and seems to be stable, there are some things I would like to see added, but I hope that in time they add some of the desired features.
chromium-browser~~~1273017338~~~cjohnston~~~5~~~Best browser ever!
chromium-browser~~~1273027375~~~Ainer~~~2~~~I'm weary of Google's data mining practices and I'm weary of anything that they have their hands in. I'm also a big fan of a number of Firefox Extensions which I can't get under Chrom* based browsers, so there's not a whole lot I found appealing here.
chromium-browser~~~1273066943~~~moorewarner~~~5~~~Chromium doesn't have Firefox's level of customizability yet, but it.is.fast.
chromium-browser~~~1273082538~~~yepi~~~3~~~Good browser, lacking some integration though, widgets in web pages are not gtk widgets. All in all it's a good browser a potential replacement of Firefox.

chromium-browser~~~1274301518~~~M4t3us~~~3~~~Shows great promise on a variety of ends, in time it can be a very good browser, but with some webpages not displaying at all, it is still impossible to use Chromium as a stand alone browser.

chromium-browser~~~1274879841~~~Ambient~~~5~~~Stable, nice interface, lots of good addons, support for synced bookmarks with your gmail is just wonderful. For webbdevelopers, it has a nice dev-interface feature that shows all kinds of minor errors on sites. Loving it!

chromium-browser~~~1275700626~~~superstargoddess~~~5~~~With so many extensions available for chrome now, this is by far better than firefox!
chromium-browser~~~1275708562~~~VegBerg~~~5~~~The best Open-Source Cross-Platform ever developed, I've used it on both Linux Mint, Ubuntu and Windows. This eats up Firefox in one second
chromium-browser~~~1275723577~~~acpcalin~~~5~~~Speed and simplicity, what else do you need from a browser?
chromium-browser~~~1275743645~~~jelevin~~~4~~~Fast

chromium-browser~~~1276650931~~~ricardojguzman~~~5~~~Fast, Stable and reliable

chromium-browser~~~1276863023~~~choneycutt5000~~~5~~~This works far better than Google Chrome on a Linux machine.
chromium-browser~~~1276945758~~~tora201~~~5~~~did I mention it is fassssssssst?

chromium-browser~~~1277186367~~~tanmays~~~5~~~Conserves screen real estate very well.
chromium-browser~~~1277409486~~~Twiguard~~~4~~~Really fast and lots of plugins, still not as fast and featureful as Opera.
chromium-browser~~~1277503589~~~Nottyl~~~1~~~I find it fairly feature-less, which means I can't set it up to make my work as fast (as in, my actual productivity, not app launch time :) to work as seamlessly as I need to. Also its font rendering tends to be quirky (very blurry unless  I run scripts to change fonts system-wide) so for anyone working from their browser, i.e. spending long hours using it, it could end up hurting their eyes.
chromium-browser~~~1277541463~~~dacoldone~~~5~~~Cool, fast and Safe! Best browser!
chromium-browser~~~1277548838~~~Solitude~~~5~~~Fast, clean and clinical. Currently has the edge in the browser wars.

chromium-browser~~~1278307481~~~baffle-boy~~~3~~~its pretty good, definitely the fastest. the only reason i cant use it is becuae i miss my add-ons and because it doesn't render some pages i go to correctly.
chromium-browser~~~1278420830~~~RobLoach~~~5~~~Replace Firefox for Chromium for upcoming Linux Mint cores!
chromium-browser~~~1278427568~~~manypieces~~~4~~~like it, i prefer it more than other browsers

chromium-browser~~~1278454034~~~zalesthebard~~~5~~~fasterrrrr
chromium-browser~~~1278542861~~~hunterm~~~5~~~Probably the fastest browser around. Countless extensions, GTK theme intergration, supports all the plugins that Firefox and alike use, super fast page loading too.
chromium-browser~~~1278606528~~~chernobit~~~5~~~The fastest browser that and tested. Beating Firefox and Opera, its interface is simple but effective. It has a huge amount of supplements and timing of the favorites is very quick.
chromium-browser~~~1278802085~~~JWalker~~~5~~~Immensely faster than Firefox was on my system! Its also has a cleaner look and feel to it.  I'm a die-hard Firefox advocate, but I've got to say... I think Chromium might have won me over for good! ;) Give it a try; this is a must-have for Linux Mint users!
chromium-browser~~~1278950793~~~dme3ha~~~5~~~faster,sleeker,extension works nice, can't wait for complete sync like in developer mode

chromium-browser~~~1279061849~~~AJAY-TECH~~~5~~~Really fast and easy to use
chromium-browser~~~1279807829~~~vineyardtechie~~~4~~~Gmail replaced t-bird, which kept freezing on compact. Gmail syscs with my other PCs, import contacts is easy, faster, better lay-out re. foldrs. takes little time to switch from t-bird!
chromium-browser~~~1279153164~~~sigixv~~~3~~~Handles sites better than firefox and minimizes the use of task bars. Main drawback is the lack of language selection (English only...)
chromium-browser~~~1279247885~~~Fuzzi99~~~5~~~I love it, it's the only webbrowser allowed on my computers as I loathe ff and opera. I also love the ability to pull websites out of the browser and turn them into applications in their own rite. and google is awsome

chromium-browser~~~1279421603~~~IcILM~~~4~~~Theme syncing worked with no problems between Chromium and Chrome
chromium-browser~~~1279547806~~~13thSlayer~~~4~~~It's not bad but honestly nothing is better than Firefox
chromium-browser~~~1279569029~~~Eric~~~3~~~It's alright if you want a simplified browser that offers a minimal interface.  It is fast and does load quickly.  However, I think that I still prefer Firefox.  Some people will like Chrome better, and it is worth having a look at it.
chromium-browser~~~1279585108~~~Celtore~~~5~~~A minimalist interface, and super fast speed. This browser does what it needs to do incredibly well.
chromium-browser~~~1287928885~~~ivanovnegro~~~4~~~I have to admit, its sooo fast.

chromium-browser~~~1290991569~~~Deadite81~~~4~~~Good browser.  Not as featureful as Firefox, but if you don't need advanced bookmarking and downloading features it's pretty good.  Firefox 4 is faster on my box, so I don't get the hype about speed.  Maybe I'm missing something...
chromium-browser~~~1288199473~~~tdockery97~~~4~~~Took me a while to warm up to it, but now I use it more than I do Firefox.

TRY UZBL... if you like speed and minimalism... but back on topic... Chromium is awesome the ONLY and I mean only thing that makes me keep firefox on my MintBox is the MAFIAA plugin.. if you don't kno what that is look it up...its amazing I'll post in firefox about that though.

chromium-browser~~~1289771072~~~raydabruce~~~5~~~I use SRWare's Iron browser.  It's Chromium with all the Google stuff stripped out of it.  Use the adblocker.ini they provide to block ads.
chromium-browser~~~1289774462~~~penguinuser~~~3~~~Good but not as good as Firefox

chromium-browser~~~1290538701~~~l1qu1d~~~4~~~Good when I need quick access to the internet!
chromium-browser~~~1290609524~~~dhoca73~~~5~~~I love Sync and tabs up. Sync adds very quickly all your preferences, bookmarks and everything you have configurated previously in Gmail. So, when you want to do a new instalation or instal Chromium in another computer, you have it ready in seconds. I think Firefox had before this feature, but the good thing of Chromium is that you configure it from Gmail

chromium-browser~~~1294449168~~~grim~~~5~~~Fast, stable and powerful. Amazing browser indeed!
chromium-browser~~~1294573514~~~sabdullah~~~5~~~Best browser
chromium-browser~~~1294709820~~~beyecixramd~~~4~~~What an awesome browser. Among the fastest, if not THE fastest browser out there. Its GTK integration sucks a bit way too much, tho. But Firefox isn't real GTK, either.
chromium-browser~~~1294759403~~~dopall~~~5~~~but unstable is better :D
chromium-browser~~~1294883242~~~Roku~~~4~~~Good, but why not use the original Chrome?
chromium-browser~~~1294976970~~~akash211~~~4~~~This is second best browser after Firefox. I use it often because it is light.
chromium-browser~~~1295137782~~~boromil~~~5~~~an awesome browser :)
chromium-browser~~~1295176538~~~cybertriveni~~~2~~~fastest but does not support all font and language

chromium-browser~~~1295328135~~~ChirmiPlay~~~4~~~Por ahora uso el Chrome de Google, pero cuando actualicen Chromium me paso sin dudar.
chromium-browser~~~1295393711~~~Minime~~~5~~~Has overtaken Firefox as my favourite web browser. Great.
chromium-browser~~~1295433843~~~MintyJay~~~3~~~I really like the speed compared to firefox, but I can't find an ad-on (like procon latte in firefox) that blocks inappropriate web sights from being able to be viewed. I find firefox more family/children friendly than chromium.
chromium-browser~~~1303392206~~~nipunsharp~~~2~~~Good thing: Starts a bit faster. Nothing else. Does not have configurability anywhere near of Firefox. Uses sparingly.
chromium-browser~~~1295477106~~~nicu~~~5~~~Best browser
chromium-browser~~~1295513234~~~RyanBigDog~~~2~~~If you like Chromium, then you need get the new Firefox 4 beta!
chromium-browser~~~1295517122~~~Elisa~~~3~~~No big deal...
chromium-browser~~~1295706998~~~davidj~~~4~~~M'agrada però a diferència del chrome li falta el català
chromium-browser~~~1295731081~~~virtualnia~~~4~~~good
chromium-browser~~~1295731366~~~podiboq~~~2~~~Tried it but as mentioned before, FF4 will beat it because of it's speed and wide support.
chromium-browser~~~1295782918~~~ishanatmuz~~~5~~~This is the best browser.
chromium-browser~~~1295836910~~~orionthehunter~~~4~~~At the moment beating Firefox 3 out for my purposes, I am frequently going back and forth though.
chromium-browser~~~1295890055~~~crom~~~5~~~Better for minilaptops than Firefox. Uses less screen space and resources.
chromium-browser~~~1296075776~~~andjelko~~~4~~~I prefer it to Firefox, not that it is bad but I like this one better.  It is somehow sleeker and faster.
chromium-browser~~~1296320280~~~jtrag~~~4~~~Firefox is still my favorite as it has been since it's release years ago; although, Chromium/Chrome is an excellent browser that seems to beat Firefox in performance from every angle.  Especially when you have a LOT of extensions installed.  Chromium can handle a TON on extensions/plugins while Firefox gets slower and slower as you add more extensions/plugins.  Also, Firefox is a memory hog which may be a problem for some that don't have much RAM to spare.  Overall, Chromium is a great browser and I give it a 4.  A few more versions from now and it just might be worthy of a perfect 5  :)
chromium-browser~~~1296421449~~~veloeric~~~5~~~+++
chromium-browser~~~1296539381~~~Ashurii~~~5~~~Fast and customizable. Love it!

chromium-browser~~~1296926284~~~superricky89~~~5~~~Velocissimo e aggiornato di continuo! Per me è il miglior browser attualmente.
chromium-browser~~~1312413441~~~Inoki~~~5~~~Ok changing the rating for the last time. After comparing this and Google's version, this is certainly better for Linux, Google's version is better for Windows and this has, since its arrival, surpassed all the other browsers with its features, lightness and speed. The most suitable browser for any user. The sync feature with your Gmail account is priceless!
chromium-browser~~~1297001897~~~Pagan~~~4~~~I like it, it's fast, clean but not without it's problems.  A lot of Websites still have issues with it, not to mention at times it will hang.  I still need to keep Firefox around, for a lot of web services like VPN access, WebEx, etc will not work correctly with Chrome.  That and there are some plugins I still can't live without, like HTTPFox.  But it is progressing nicely and hopefully I won't need FF any longer.
chromium-browser~~~1297074088~~~quaie~~~5~~~until now I didn't have any problems with it, only using it as a simple browser, nothing fancy; youtube is displayed ok with it, so I don't see any reasons to switch to the resource hog which is mozilla; and
chromium-browser~~~1297092646~~~b3n_2g0~~~5~~~Better than Firefox. With Noscript(with encrypt password) plus Adblock, this is way better than Firefox. However, the issue is Patches.

chromium-browser~~~1319935577~~~W4RP1G~~~4~~~Great browser.  The google store gives it an edge over other browsers with free apps that run in the browser.  Needs better support on some websites.  I tried to post an item on eBay and had to use Firefox since the upload pics part wasn't working.  Overall, it's my preferred browser, though Firefox is better supported on some websites.

chromium-bsu~~~1273612580~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~This is a very nice game. I remember I tried playing it about 8 years ago and my system was just not enough. It was actually needing a better video card but as was a casual gamer I suffered a bit. Anyway, very nice game. I like the graphics, the sounds and the fact that the ship and enemies are original. :)
chromium-bsu~~~1274204492~~~mikkh~~~5~~~The game to test if your 3D drivers are working correctly - also a very good game
chromium-bsu~~~1276780887~~~vipek~~~3~~~Good game with great graphics and animation. But it becomes boring after a few minutes.
chromium-bsu~~~1277781855~~~smartsaga~~~3~~~The original had better music (heavy metal style) that made the game rock. The music on this one kills it after a minute or two... meh
chromium-bsu~~~1286678178~~~tpapastylianou~~~5~~~A classic! One of the oldest properly gfx accelerated games for linux, and still one of the best space shooters out there. Unique in its approach, in that the goal is to shoot down *every single enemy spaceship*; for every enemy that escapes your spaceship explodes. This creates a very different dynamic to other space shooters, as you often need to adopt a 'kamikaze' strategy and crash into enemy spaceships before they manage to escape. Good graphics, very challenging! Love it!
chromium-bsu~~~1287173326~~~dazw2000~~~4~~~Great graphics and playability, but gets to repetative after a while

cmatrix~~~1298848889~~~Anubis~~~4~~~If you live on a tty console, it can make a great screensaver. Pretty useless otherwise :)
cmus~~~1274638438~~~patriki~~~5~~~Lecteur très leger.
codeblocks~~~1275156100~~~brownhead~~~5~~~I've used it with Mac OS X, Windows Vista, and Linux, and it runs beautifully on all three (though the Mac version can be a bit buggy). Excellent barebones IDE.

codeblocks~~~1275983338~~~mudur2~~~4~~~its cool
codeblocks~~~1276922432~~~Vincent~~~4~~~Played around with it a bit; it's a lightweight IDE that works well if you want something a bit more intuitive than nano or geany.
codeblocks~~~1278254371~~~srini2174~~~4~~~This is an outdated version.  The current version is 10.05.  It would be better if it is upgraded as the latest one is the stable release
codeblocks~~~1313674680~~~uditmukherjee457~~~4~~~one of the best of its kind
codeblocks~~~1279604557~~~sipiatti~~~3~~~It is a C++ IDE, just to clarify...
codeblocks~~~1282451729~~~Lendoxx~~~4~~~Ótimo!
codeblocks~~~1287229199~~~kronomia~~~5~~~Code::Blocks is one of the best open-source, cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I highly recommend using this IDE under Unix and Linux-based Operating Systems.

codeblocks~~~1293604563~~~mohu~~~4~~~I like it....
codeblocks~~~1294330442~~~bunty-arnab~~~4~~~Nice One for starters to try.. If you are interested for tiny C programs on Linux maintaining proper ANSI format and something that can make editing and compiling C codes easy then try this. I'm sure you'll Love it

codeblocks~~~1304542069~~~easy~~~5~~~This is the best open source C++ development IDE I've ever used! It's extensible, it's highly configurable, it comes with code completion, many useful templates and with all the convinience that I was ever looking for in an IDE. Try it out!

codeblocks~~~1307153240~~~diegoCode~~~4~~~Excelente para principiantes. Simple y liviano; multiplataforma.
codeblocks~~~1308457919~~~digiter~~~3~~~I like Dev-C++ more.
codeblocks~~~1312029358~~~mintlinux~~~5~~~The program's gui is good, but my "if" c++ statments are getting skipped. On the other hand, Code::Blocks is a great IDE.
codeblocks~~~1312052992~~~trollboy~~~5~~~It's amazing what gems you find when browsing round this community. Code::Blocks is one of them. As a beginner to c, I need an IDE that helps me but doesn't do all the work for me. I've found it.
codeblocks~~~1315057521~~~Sepidar~~~4~~~CODEBLOCKS is greate, but its code completion has long way to be perfect
codeblocks~~~1319366526~~~tuxD3v~~~5~~~The best IDE for C/C++!!
codelite~~~1287243393~~~srini2174~~~4~~~It is an excellent IDE, but the current version is not available in the repository.  It would be good if the latest version of this is added.
codelite~~~1320372010~~~Rabidgnoll~~~5~~~It is really good. Better than Code::Blocks even.
codelite~~~1294042067~~~ReckouNT~~~5~~~+1 to the last comment. Soft is good, but this version is too old :)

compiz~~~1274285988~~~huntman~~~5~~~yes nice
compiz~~~1274282716~~~vadi01~~~5~~~what aero is for windows...compiz is for linux. and far far much better. I recommend you install compiz-fusion-plugins-extra as well with this.
compiz~~~1274717366~~~pho3nixf1re~~~5~~~Easf to use, awesome effects, can help productivity too.
compiz~~~1274725232~~~majortws~~~4~~~It's great, if configured right, but can be a real waste of resources.

compiz~~~1280359271~~~ivanovnegro~~~4~~~I like it really. Good effects and makes fun. You dont need but it makes your linux desktop more special.
compiz~~~1280603516~~~admiralspark~~~5~~~The Compiz window manager is amazing! Far superior desktop effects to anything Aero or Aqua could put out!
compiz~~~1282411086~~~incogita~~~4~~~Superb; very fast and yet with mind blowing effects.
compiz~~~1283826164~~~tomofpittsburgh~~~3~~~i hope  it works this time.
compiz~~~1283891280~~~Zethy~~~5~~~I loved compiz since I first saw it in a friends computer. Now my girlfriend is asking me how to make her windows wobble in her MS-Windows laptop. This is a great way to impress and convert Windows users.
compiz~~~1284428314~~~ozos~~~4~~~Nice effects
compiz~~~1285023781~~~ceptor~~~5~~~wunderbare desktoperweiterung mit einer fuelle an effekten

compiz~~~1291515707~~~Sol_Badguy~~~5~~~Amazing visual effects on the desktop.
compiz~~~1292670750~~~Shostako~~~5~~~The best visual effects in an OS. And some of them, very useful.

compiz~~~1294332363~~~bunty-arnab~~~4~~~Awesome...  Something that makes me crazy about linux
compiz~~~1294336881~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Love it! I just wish the reflection plugin would stay out of the drop shadow. Who ever heard of a shadow having a reflection?!
compiz~~~1295799813~~~kunk~~~5~~~Works great even on my ATi Mobility Radeon X1450. You can configure just about anything.
compiz~~~1298521473~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~very great, for visual effects 3d desktop, making the desktop can be rotated (rotate / flexible), great.
compiz~~~1298848664~~~Mitzh~~~5~~~amazing... love that you can tweak so many things
compiz~~~1300548387~~~HATRED~~~5~~~\\o//
compiz~~~1300988827~~~cMo2011~~~5~~~This is the future of the desktop experience, only problem is I cant run a screensaver with the effects. Using a 512mb 8800 gt.
compiz~~~1303374164~~~DynamicMan~~~5~~~I'm just such a sucker for rotating desktop cubes and wobbly windows. Nevermind all the stuff that is actually useful. :)
compiz~~~1304454762~~~gpfwestie~~~5~~~Absolutely brilliant and incredibly pretty. Pinning open aps onto it transforms the whole user experience.
compiz~~~1304482310~~~kaban~~~5~~~Has a lot of very useful tools for desktop management
compiz~~~1306838331~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~4~~~good tool for desktop effects
compiz~~~1314112840~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~Pretty cool, very useful for windows management
compiz~~~1312116752~~~RavS~~~5~~~Excellent window manager! (haven't tried anything else though :)
compiz~~~1312116951~~~trollboy~~~4~~~Paired with Emerald, this is truly awesome and pretty.  With light use of effects, it can improve your work flow. With heavy use of effects it can give you a migraine!
compiz~~~1313575877~~~prativasic~~~5~~~If there was no Compiz, I would not have used Gnome
compiz~~~1313645090~~~Labby~~~5~~~Love it!
compiz~~~1313919176~~~Kvaks~~~5~~~It's not just about eye candy and toys, though there is that too. Compiz also brings features to your desktop that are extremely USEFUL! I'd be frustrated as hell if I had to do without Compiz on my main computer.
compiz~~~1314125258~~~chumney_2000~~~2~~~I really DO like it. The bad rating comes with the fact that it lags really bad on 3 out of 3 machines ive tested. One of those being a quad-core. I really do like the "eye-candy" and all the features, but I'm not the only one having lag problems, till this gets fixed I'm afraid I will have to use metacity. Not as pretty, but it fixes the lag, and never let me down!
compiz~~~1322048222~~~Simeon~~~5~~~5, but needs improvement.
compiz-check~~~1298522967~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~good, script to test.

compizconfig-settings-manager~~~1282411194~~~incogita~~~4~~~This settings manager allows you to change pretty much every aspect of compiz. However, it could be a little more user friendly; some of the options are not immediately obvious as to their function.
compizconfig-settings-manager~~~1283826246~~~tomofpittsburgh~~~4~~~it's great, just be prepared to do a search for it from your mint menu.  i have no idea where it installs to.

computer-janitor-gtk~~~1287175951~~~dazw2000~~~2~~~Could do with some more deeper cleaning features
computer-janitor-gtk~~~1288607958~~~punkrtekk~~~4~~~It is good, but there is a huge space for improvement.
computer-janitor-gtk~~~1289206669~~~riki~~~4~~~IMO no damage can be done. If it tells that "it is no longer needed" go for it and clean your system.

computer-janitor-gtk~~~1305575401~~~aljazek~~~2~~~Not so useful.

computertemp~~~1295491679~~~simmy~~~3~~~transparency problems..but works, just looks nasty with some themes/without tweaking (edit, should say it supports true transparency, unlike the tray icons, so it looks out of place, if other gnome programs followed a standard this would look sweet
computertemp~~~1295077865~~~Elisa~~~3~~~No big deal...
computertemp~~~1295492601~~~grim~~~3~~~Meh, works...
computertemp~~~1296535040~~~MestreLion~~~2~~~It only detected a single sensor from a single souce (Kernel i2c hwmon),  thus making it quite useless. sensors-applet is a MUCH better choice. On the plus side, this one has a log feature.

conky~~~1271330004~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~Als System-Monitor ist er das, was man sich wünscht, unglaublich anpassbar. Wenn doch nur eine ebenso tolle zusätzliche Konfigurationssoftware da wäre. So bleibt es das Lieblingsspielzeug der Tastaturcowboys, während es der Otto-Normalbenutzer nur mit vorgefertigten Skripts nutzen kann.
conky~~~1273947201~~~jkw~~~5~~~Truly awesome customization posibilitys. And if anyone know where to find the conky file for the one in the screenie, send me a pm. :-P
conky~~~1278607107~~~chernobit~~~5~~~Impressive. The best system monitor. 100% also amended to occupy no system resources, the only drawback is the lack of help, but can do wonders with it.
conky~~~1280409158~~~linXea~~~5~~~isn't it much more fun creating your own all-in-all window-widget? Conky is a must have for me.
conky~~~1283573106~~~mmesantos1~~~5~~~Well it does what you tell it too. If you it does not then you did not config it correctly. It is as good as you make it. :-)
conky~~~1295983693~~~efthialex~~~5~~~One word, PERFECT!
conky~~~1307489074~~~damnated~~~5~~~Great!

conky-all~~~1271954674~~~KittyKatt~~~5~~~Absolutely amazing. One of the greatest Linux applications I've ever used.

conky-all~~~1275011509~~~thx1138~~~5~~~The best system monitor. Many individual configurations can be done within minutes.
conky-all~~~1275130126~~~jacobdb~~~4~~~good app, but a little tricky to configure.
conky-all~~~1275523613~~~qa_fan99~~~5~~~Great app, lots of examples availavle to show how to configure
conky-all~~~1275573604~~~asdfz0r~~~4~~~Best systemmonitor available, configuration is tricky at beginning but after spending some time with it, it just works. Fancy little thing, this application.
conky-all~~~1275575916~~~SeanBest~~~5~~~Just awesome, hardest part is figuring out what you want because there's so many options!
conky-all~~~1275591678~~~linuxmint~~~5~~~Awesome app for Linux, although for some it might be hard to setup :)
conky-all~~~1275599330~~~huntman~~~5~~~Great app.
conky-all~~~1277829466~~~farnaby~~~4~~~quite nice, but more of a geeky toy. if i just want to know what's going on on my computer, i use htop.
conky-all~~~1276980317~~~mmesantos1~~~4~~~Great system monitor app, need to do some homework before you can get it working but worth the effort.
conky-all~~~1307889064~~~sajukktheeternal~~~1~~~no. Absolutely not. I regret having spent time with this. It takes user friendliness at least 10 years behind. The philosophy of this is SO against Mint. So many happy comments, and none telling the truth: This is not just a non user-friendly program. It's a "user shove off" program
conky-all~~~1279403747~~~Celtore~~~4~~~Difficult to set up, however once it is working, this lightweight system monitor can literally fit into any kind of desktop environment
conky-all~~~1280444828~~~Tropico~~~5~~~great
conky-all~~~1281712285~~~Jac978~~~5~~~This is one of the first applications what I take after Mint install.

conky-all~~~1287328061~~~mentos001~~~5~~~for our friend who said it doesn't work in isadora, you must create the conky config file and optimise it before
conky-all~~~1287542611~~~sklinux~~~5~~~Great and beautiful

conky-all~~~1294451026~~~grim~~~5~~~Your imagination is the limit! Very useful!
conky-all~~~1294803384~~~miana~~~1~~~It's very hard to configure and to use. Not suitable for 80% people in this world. You should make it user friendly, otherwise most people in the world cannot use it all all.
conky-all~~~1294900335~~~DIONISIS_POLITIS~~~4~~~it looks very nice although not absolutely necessary. It's fun to configure it!
conky-all~~~1295402779~~~crownabhisek~~~5~~~Handome really
conky-all~~~1295959978~~~efthialex~~~5~~~I Love it!
conky-all~~~1296375984~~~bikerboi87~~~5~~~absolutely brilliant. the configuration file may put people off, but it's definately an incredibly useful and powerful program
conky-all~~~1297382418~~~zapa~~~3~~~Not verry usefull but nice ...
conky-all~~~1297382888~~~mikefreeman~~~2~~~I'm not against anyone using it, but it's not for me, and doesn't seem like it's compatible with the purpose behind Mint. Just about anything I'd use it for could be done MUCH easier and also visually appealing with panel applets, screenlets, or other means.
conky-all~~~1297434860~~~guv999~~~5~~~Excellent program - saves having screenlets or applets to get system information and looks more integrated with the desktop .   That said, it is not straight forward to configure and expect to take some time and potentially refer to tutorials and forums.   The results are well worth it though
conky-all~~~1297998125~~~velheru~~~5~~~...
conky-all~~~1299698611~~~M_onkeyman~~~4~~~Cool little app, light and customizable; only problem can be learning how to program the app, but other than that, awesome.

conky-all~~~1302470667~~~nospoftombl~~~4~~~All infos you need, looks great
conky-all~~~1304771554~~~Aleksandar~~~2~~~Not user friendly. I prefer screenlets/gadgets/widgets solution over this.

conky-all~~~1309378668~~~blueXrider~~~1~~~Doesn't play well with Katya and Compiz
conky-all~~~1310630340~~~prativasic~~~3~~~Conky is, of course much powerful and soothing for eye. But, its user-friendliness sucks! yeah that's true. I never found a good resource to understand it completely. However, I'll look forward for the day when there will be customizable GUI tools for Conky Configuration.

cowsay~~~1297715097~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Good and useful, remembering also the cool Husse ;) [: Haekon, r u 'ok'? :-\  :EOF]
cowsay~~~1297718893~~~mikefreeman~~~2~~~Cute and funny, but really shouldn't be included as a default. Makes the greatness of Mint look suddenly corny the moment you open a terminal. Try to uninstall it, and it gets rid of things you don't want to get rid of. That's not good.
cowsay~~~1298134415~~~BlaBlaBlub~~~1~~~Why as standard?

crawl~~~1274526364~~~xavi~~~5~~~Better than Nethack, sure! This is a wonderful roguelike eveolving fast and with nice gui.
crawl~~~1274901323~~~JamezQ~~~5~~~If only todays game could be as detailed as this
crawl~~~1276606037~~~vipek~~~2~~~I didn't like this game. Nice GUI? It's a text-based game :) BTW, it doesn't create menu shortcut, so to run it you have to open terminal and type "crawl".
crawl~~~1291656763~~~sonic4spuds~~~5~~~This is by far the best program of its kind, giving you an easily used interface and all of the features of the classic rouge like game. A different package contains the non graphical version.
crawl~~~1291658029~~~Rikstation~~~2~~~Terminal based game - Not for me

cream~~~1307387414~~~Althorion~~~3~~~May become handy, but I would rather recommend learning pure VIM.
cron~~~1311597180~~~bugz~~~4~~~Old-fashion good scheduler. Usually it takes an action on servers, but if you can find the idea what to run on workstation on the regular basis that app would be good choice. Plain text configuration file syntax is easy to understand.
cryptkeeper~~~1271328708~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~Mit diesem Programm kann man mit verschlüsselten Verzeichnissen arbeiten und diese nach Bedarf ein- und aushängen, was vor allem für Benutzer von Akkubetriebenen Geräten sehr sinnvoll sein dürfte. Ein eingehängtes Verzeichnis kann natürlich, je nach Einstellungen des Systems, auch von außen betrachtet werden, hier sollte man sich entsprechend ein wenig Kenntnis erarbeiten.

csound~~~1295909263~~~eaglebauer~~~5~~~First: I'm a big fan of Csound. Drawback: in the actual version the adsyn produces only noise. An old (4.08) Windows version works fine via wine though, but it is very inconvenient and a slow workflow.
cssed~~~1302318190~~~dardevelin~~~3~~~Seams ok, was expecting a little more.. Maybe my bad
cssed~~~1305371431~~~trollboy~~~4~~~Always installed but not often used these days.  A super tool when you are stuck with CSS syntax
cssed~~~1320810232~~~Squirrel~~~4~~~This simple, quick, easy program does exactly what it sets out to do. Anytime you have to make or modify a CSS file and want to see the whole picture, fire it up!
cultivation~~~1299807447~~~Zer0~~~5~~~Great mix of a Sim/RPG game.

deja-dup~~~1305037311~~~marphy~~~3~~~Not bad, but lacks a smart mechanism for the deletion of old backups, which is crucial to me.
deja-dup~~~1306946795~~~RytronII~~~5~~~Perfect for both encrypting and incremental backups. The plain appearence belies just how great this utility is.
deja-dup~~~1307810386~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~4~~~useful tool for backing up your data
deja-dup~~~1314113428~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~revaluated, works as it should
deja-dup~~~1310116064~~~jose_r~~~4~~~It is good but too simple. The backups are treated as a single block. You cannot delete or restore only a part of the backup, for example.

deja-dup~~~1320187009~~~chassum~~~4~~~Easy configuration and supports backups to networked drives. Would be better if it allowed selective restore, but that would almost certainly make things slower and more complicated.
dell-recovery~~~1284952634~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Be sure to read what the recovery image will do before you use it! It looks like a great tool, but as any tool, it must be used properly, with an idea of what you're doing.

deluge~~~1274450216~~~isbura~~~5~~~Excellent utorrent clone. The best client on Linux. So far ahead of Transmission it's a mystery why distros continue to bundle the latter instead of Deluge.

deluge~~~1277024170~~~crom~~~3~~~Too many unnecessary options. Uses seven times more memory than Transmission. Not faster or slower than Transmission.

deluge~~~1291413107~~~Deadite81~~~4~~~A good torrent client.  It has it's flaws, but it includes a queuing system, which is what Transmission notably lacks.

deluge~~~1291634945~~~sigmundklaus~~~5~~~essential, just does what it is meant to do
deluge~~~1291998825~~~saurabh2804~~~4~~~Great Torrent client. Except, it sometimes uses 100% of CPU for some strange reason.
deluge~~~1292111158~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~I started using Deluge because it offers almost everything I was used to with uTorrent. With a few more touches here and there it will be an excellent BitTorrent client.
deluge~~~1292621081~~~gioblack92~~~4~~~ottimo torrent manager
deluge~~~1293738404~~~robertofmj~~~5~~~Other bittorrent clients in linux, have poor features. Delugue is unique possible to set half-connections, time for new peers per second. This features are great for low end routers and avoid nat crash table resulting in http down
deluge~~~1293888042~~~vallycn~~~5~~~faster than anyother BT downloader
deluge~~~1293906820~~~Shovel~~~5~~~A great torrent client. Its simple yet customizable. Low overhead and has a working scheduler plugin! A good choice.

deluge~~~1303509341~~~groovydaddy~~~5~~~This is my favorite Torrent app!  When I'm browsing the web, I don't mind using Opera since it is open anyway.  I prefer using Deluge though.
deluge~~~1304198746~~~necromantiarian~~~1~~~to my surprise vuze is faster, even if written on java
deluge~~~1304262156~~~lukyjay~~~5~~~Incredible with plugin support
deluge~~~1304727250~~~chinoto~~~4~~~It was my favorite client for a long time and did it's job well, but it has a bug where it will randomly use 100% cpu until restarted. I've switched to qBittorrent because it supports Webseeds and Tracker Exchange (not too useful until uTorrent and other clients implement it though), and it contacts all available trackers simultaneously instead of sequentially for more peers (and slightly more bandwidth).
deluge~~~1305269732~~~spacy01~~~5~~~Perfect piece of soft! :)

deluge~~~1307191086~~~kazz~~~5~~~Bien plus complet que Transmission, et étonnamment plus rapide : le client P2P idéal, qui devrait être par défaut dans la distri.
deluge~~~1307265630~~~RavS~~~4~~~Does the job properly without much show. Though I have to connect it manually everytime I restart the computer and that is a bit pain.

deluge~~~1308454047~~~sivaram~~~5~~~like it very much
deluge~~~1308581613~~~charpour~~~3~~~I had a number of issues using deluge and thus I switched to qBittorrent which is absolutely lovely! (I strongly recommend that)

deluge~~~1311608243~~~angelhjose~~~4~~~Good
deluge~~~1311876512~~~sigurd1701~~~5~~~my favourite. Best for beginners with its convenience and speed. Sometimes still switch back to transmission because of better control of details
deluge~~~1312170243~~~Sol_Badguy~~~5~~~Nice :)
deluge~~~1312980101~~~MaTachi~~~5~~~Awesome torrent client. Better than uTorrent. ;)
deluge~~~1313679159~~~linuxali~~~5~~~excellent 5*****
deluge~~~1314375999~~~Tonya~~~5~~~Excellent torrent client! But I also use Transmission and uTorrent.
deluge~~~1314753138~~~danstinebaugh~~~5~~~Love that I can have a headless server running in the background and I can just use this as a remote to it. Flawless!
deluge~~~1315167543~~~Swill~~~5~~~The best! Hope it would be native in Linux Mint 12 :)
deluge~~~1317186639~~~mjoens41~~~4~~~interface not as nice as qbittorrent, but deluge just works better, highly recommended

deluge~~~1320683131~~~efthialex~~~5~~~????? ? ????????? Torrent Client ??? ??? ?????????????? ?? ????????? ??????!
deluge~~~1320864841~~~ammaretto~~~5~~~IMHO the Best!
deluge~~~1321738430~~~kelay~~~2~~~The client is simple, but slow. It hasn't enough modules to fix speed problems
deluge-torrent~~~1273296000~~~Kainous~~~5~~~Like Utorret. Small, Simple, yet packed with features.
deluge-torrent~~~1275382845~~~Basil8~~~5~~~The best torrent-client IMHO
deluge-torrent~~~1276600493~~~huntman~~~5~~~best
deluge-torrent~~~1281082469~~~filosofem666~~~5~~~This should be the default Bittorrent client.
deluge-torrent~~~1288852128~~~Elisa~~~4~~~Cool !
deluge-torrent~~~1294936281~~~grim~~~5~~~Best bittorrent client that I know of... but I dont think it should be the default, since Transmission is also good, and way more simple and user friendly :3
deluge-torrent~~~1299549833~~~noaptus~~~5~~~The best of the best :)
deluge-torrent~~~1301097661~~~Rikstation~~~5~~~I use as my main bittorrent client. Very simple and easy to use
deluge-torrent~~~1301174879~~~pasemes~~~5~~~muito bom
denemo~~~1294503870~~~Silent_Warrior~~~4~~~The interface is a bit of a handful, and not what I'd call intuitive, but it gets the job done. If you put in enough effort, the end result is actually really good. There is that little 'enough effort' thing that brings the grade down a little. All the same: This is THE score editor, as far as I'm concerned, at least for Linux.
denyhosts~~~1275157075~~~AndrewX192~~~5~~~One of the best tools to lock out hackers who try to crack usernames and passwords on your linux server. If your running openssh-server be sure to install this.
denyhosts~~~1278991726~~~zulugrid~~~5~~~Awesome utility. A "must have".

diffuse~~~1275284379~~~maliku~~~4~~~I use it for replace the beyondcompare.
diffuse~~~1275537555~~~opticyclic~~~4~~~Nice diff/merge. Need to use Meld to diff directories though.
diffuse~~~1292147191~~~Inoki~~~5~~~Best out there :)
diffuse~~~1301670597~~~farnaby~~~5~~~Wow. Just came across this one and I'm amazed. :) Much more comfortable for comparing large text-files than using command line diff.
diffuse~~~1308949725~~~makk~~~4~~~Personally I prefer meld. You could also try kompare.
diffuse~~~1313787947~~~dodies~~~4~~~Mi piace utile per il confronto di codice, meno per i file di testo semplici. Rispetto a Meld manca la messa in evidenza dei caratteri che provocano la differenza all'interno della stringa di testo. Ha opzioni di selezione che mancano a Meld...insomma simili ma da provare entrambi.
diffutils~~~1294417548~~~sigma-ml~~~5~~~Very handy tools.
digikam~~~1268946114~~~Teucca~~~4~~~Photo edit and collection
digikam~~~1271330452~~~mixedbredie~~~5~~~Digital asset management made (relatively) easy. There is a bit of initial setup required (creating metadata templates and image libraries) but the website has fantastic documentation. The developer and user mailing lists are very good too. Active ddevelopment and regular updates means the software improves all the time. Options to edit images as part of the work flow (and batch edit) means I use external editors (Gimp) less and less. I switched from Gnome Mint to KDE Mint to use it and haven't looked back.
digikam~~~1273153328~~~nilsgeylen~~~4~~~Pity this isn't Gnome native or it would be awesome. But it's the best photo manager I've encountered so far, beating F-Spot by a long run. It's companion image editor is great
digikam~~~1275013564~~~cybergaar~~~5~~~Best and works okay with gnome
digikam~~~1275560388~~~dorylinux~~~5~~~...ho usato per anni bridge, ma questo software è superiore pperchè non scomoda Gimp per operazioni semplici come il ridimensionare, creare gallerie etc... sono un fotografo professionista dal 1990
digikam~~~1277197288~~~kage~~~4~~~It's the best! Some issues with stabillity.
digikam~~~1280713106~~~Abd3l~~~2~~~Not bad, i dont,like it that much but it keeps getting stuck when i put the photo up for editting.
digikam~~~1281032862~~~Delta_Magic~~~2~~~If you decide you don't like it and want to uninstall it, simply uninstalling Digikam is not enough since it also adds stuff like Konqueror and Dolphin to your system which must be uninstalled individually. I think they should all be linked in the uninstallation, since they are in the installation. No a big fan of KDE software and now I'm even more annoyed with it...
digikam~~~1283944669~~~fanisatt~~~4~~~It is very good in KDE too.
digikam~~~1286458326~~~ALAINROBE~~~5~~~Es mas potente que los visores de windows en cuanto a herramientas de administración de fotografias, pero se deberia trabajar mas en su velocidad. Pero sus funciones, para administrar fotos, justifican la mas alta calificación
digikam~~~1287477689~~~titohal~~~5~~~The main advantage: Digikam album is an actual folder in your computer, it doesn,t need to import your files to it's database. It's also a good editing software.
digikam~~~1289059757~~~jajodo~~~5~~~OMG. I am a Gnome guy but this is awsome.  Leaves the photos in your folders rather than a db file. Edits exif data including dates.  Much more full featured than the Gnome alternatives.  Installs a few KDE programs: Dolphin, Konqueror for unclear reasons though.
digikam~~~1293169531~~~JeanGrosJean~~~5~~~I've trtied them all: F-Spot, Shotwell, Mirage, Picasa, etc. DigiKam beats them all by a long shot. The best photo manager.
digikam~~~1295388446~~~mpkingsley~~~4~~~Great alternative to iPhoto and Picassa; supports more advanced tools than either; I am excited about the newer features to be released: file revision history & Facial recognition!
digikam~~~1295518080~~~Elris~~~5~~~Simply the best photo manager
digikam~~~1296428204~~~kip-~~~5~~~absolutely exceletne! it does everything.. from flash galleries to exporting pictures or album on you facebook.. got thanks for this app!
digikam~~~1299918975~~~mfy1992~~~5~~~?????
digikam~~~1308819060~~~farocker~~~4~~~Great stuff !
digikam~~~1315795683~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~If I wanted KDE I would have installed it. Has too many dependant files and installs KDE programs that I dont want on my system. Resource heavy. Not for me
digikam~~~1309097737~~~NickR~~~1~~~Just like blueXrider !
digikam~~~1315595423~~~Examiner~~~5~~~Second glowing review for digikam! I have used Foto Finish for many years, and tried without success, to find a way to use it on Linux Mint 10. After many days, and many hours of searching, I finally found digikam. Seems to do exactly what I needed, and very comparable to SmartDraw's program FotoFinish. Not sure if it is still made by the Smart Draw company, but we had thousands of photos and images that were created with it, over the last 8 or 9 years. Digikam appears to fill the bill, and easy to use, too!
digikam~~~1316831267~~~Kain~~~4~~~Sometimes a little slow and complicated, but far better than any native gnome application. I only wish it was native for gnome.
digikam~~~1318027283~~~ento~~~5~~~The best implementation of organizing my photocollection.
digikam-doc~~~1271433535~~~mixedbredie~~~4~~~A very useful comprehensive document to have at hand. Can either download PDF or read it online in HTML format.
ding~~~1319801232~~~luxy~~~5~~~Schnell und einfach zu bedienen.
directvnc~~~1278020575~~~Rovanion~~~2~~~Text only
djview4~~~1307170879~~~Artichoke~~~3~~~Good viewer but can't select and save the OCR'd text.
dmidecode~~~1288218704~~~asymmetros~~~5~~~It does what it says. Running from a terminal, gives a ton of information about your system
dmraid~~~1300548300~~~HATRED~~~5~~~I love it! Especially the speed up on raid 0.

docky~~~1275704906~~~superstargoddess~~~2~~~Not very customizable, unable to put it anywhere except on the screen edges.  Weather applet did not work.
docky~~~1276114215~~~artic112~~~5~~~Very beautiful and very powerfull application
docky~~~1276275212~~~Shakz~~~5~~~The search function thats available in Gnome Do is missing but it has a 3D feature that makes it look flippen awesome. Defo my dock of choice. Functional and pretty!
docky~~~1278454382~~~zalesthebard~~~4~~~the first really non-copy of max toolbar
docky~~~1289846420~~~Xyie~~~4~~~While docks aren't normally my choice interface, this one works nicely and simply. No need to install compiz under Xfce or GNOME, just enable compositing! Only downsides: some of the features don't seem to start for me (like the battery monitor) and if you're using multiple desktop environments, but want it to start only on one of those, you have to manually start it. (Or else make some sort of script only on that desktop, I guess.)
docky~~~1280101443~~~lewah~~~4~~~Good but too simple (cannot offsetting position)
docky~~~1280185255~~~Delta_Magic~~~5~~~Awesome dock! For my needs, Docky is superior to both AWN and Cairo. You can't customize every single detail, but there are certainly enough features available to play around a little. The dock gives a very elegant feel from the start and the only downside I've encountered thus far is that the feature that is supposed to show the Deluge transfer speed in the dock isn't working.
docky~~~1281286000~~~dme3ha~~~4~~~drag n drop, easy on my 5 yrs-old notebook, simple and practical
docky~~~1305624541~~~ODmitriyA~~~5~~~Very well!

docky~~~1286562640~~~jessie0514~~~5~~~Nice dock as compared to other w/c is eating so much ram. This one is definitely awesome.
docky~~~1288879482~~~damien-tt~~~5~~~Sweet! 4 stars!
docky~~~1289134516~~~LeoGhost~~~5~~~This is a biased review as I haven't tried the other dock programs, though after installing this one I didn't need to. It just works, not too fancy but has enough features for the average user. It's smooth as well, not a resource hog. Thumbs up.
docky~~~1290445869~~~FunkyWhale~~~5~~~Awesome. More robust than its depreciated gnome-do integration.

docky~~~1294882053~~~idude_aldunate~~~5~~~me gusta mucho
docky~~~1295464223~~~ChirmiPlay~~~4~~~Docky + los íconos del LMDE = Linux es más bonito que Mac. El único problema que tengo es que interfiere cuando estoy jugando algunos juegos en pantalla completa (sí, está configurado para que se oculte, pero sucede igual).
docky~~~1296801272~~~mikefreeman~~~5~~~Excellent dock. Very stable, simple, and elegant!
docky~~~1297358978~~~oneparadoxyPL~~~5~~~Nice looking app loader... and its just nice add to wallpaper in HD. Awesome. PL: Bardzo ?adny dodatek do pulpitu. Odpalacz programów a jak ?adnie zdobi.

docky~~~1299522963~~~romanybob~~~5~~~Easy, fast, looks great. Not as many options as awn (avant window navigator) but for some reason I love it!  Need to have Gnome or compiz composting turned on.

docky~~~1300103353~~~dweight~~~4~~~like it :)
docky~~~1300638743~~~ish05~~~4~~~AWN was glitching on me. This is not. Also, dockey seems faster as well
docky~~~1302632307~~~gnoxy84~~~5~~~Love it!
docky~~~1302722989~~~LinkOS~~~1~~~.... crap !
docky~~~1303197390~~~Lex8P~~~2~~~requires composting to work... enable composting and system behaves weird
docky~~~1303695664~~~JonBjSig~~~4~~~Awesome except for one annoying thing, the auto-hide always bugs out so you can't see the dock through anything.

docky~~~1307396608~~~magicbus~~~4~~~Decent dock. Have used it in the past, and it is definitely a good choice, but I prefer Cairo-Dock.

docky~~~1309618609~~~SeventhReign~~~5~~~Fast.  Not as feature rich as AWN, but still great.
docky~~~1309898920~~~Tannn3r~~~5~~~Works great!
docky~~~1310037063~~~Inoki~~~5~~~The only comparable difference between this and AWN is that Docky is very light.
docky~~~1310320615~~~lourdchien~~~5~~~Great, and well integrated in the GNOME desktop. LM11

docky~~~1315748104~~~djbruce26~~~5~~~Fantastic dock, never gave me any troubles. I love the usefulness of the colored dots. I can't imagine how much harder it would be to use linux without Docky...
docky~~~1317214236~~~niowfi~~~4~~~I like it. 4* beacause some programs like Libreoffice cannot be attached to the dock.
docky~~~1319020909~~~skumara~~~4~~~Like it. Just another great dock!

dolphin~~~1279891814~~~Roin~~~5~~~Since I started using KDE I started to love this File Browser <3
dolphin~~~1279897946~~~ivanovnegro~~~3~~~I admit, using Gnome so I dont really like Dolphin, too much things for me but its very powerfull.
dolphin~~~1280006107~~~ledjin~~~5~~~Try it. It is very good file browser. And of course the best of Linux file browsers
dolphin~~~1280277536~~~71KR117~~~4~~~I recommend it for all the single clickers out there.
dolphin~~~1281561632~~~bgbraithwaite~~~5~~~Very nice file manager, very powerful & clean.

dolphin~~~1292672712~~~Shostako~~~4~~~A good file manager.
dolphin~~~1307392734~~~Germmare~~~5~~~Rating=1 Top Software, my opinion
dooble~~~1269764605~~~ddalley~~~3~~~A very new, immature browser at ver. 0.07. It focuses on its search engine, which returns a lot of German links. It won't load some web pages (times out) or it won't run some page elements. It can be really fast, sometimes, though. I just installed it after finding it listed here and I'll watch if it grows. Gave it a neutral rating because it is so new.
dooble~~~1286609547~~~Cougar~~~4~~~A interesting internet browser, good feature subset.  My favorite WebKit Browser
dooble~~~1286645468~~~ceptor~~~5~~~another awesome web-browser
dooble~~~1290604074~~~Elisa~~~3~~~No big deal...
dopewars~~~1274204756~~~mikkh~~~1~~~DOS nostalgia freaks only
dopewars~~~1275108408~~~focalguy~~~4~~~If you know what this game is then you already know if you like it. Nothing really new here. Close to the same game I have on my phone. Same old "buy low, sell high" gameplay.
dopewars~~~1277364551~~~axel668~~~4~~~absolute classic
dopewars~~~1279314096~~~dckjnsn~~~5~~~niiiiiiiice.  played this first in 2004
dopewars~~~1296344526~~~donuthater~~~4~~~Good as other versions!
dopewars~~~1300011438~~~lobo32~~~1~~~Don't get the point of it ...
dopewars~~~1300398805~~~Zer0~~~5~~~Simply epic.
dosbox~~~1270922169~~~Roin~~~4~~~Great DOS emulator, but sadly the Linux version has some issues, e.g. with some sound emulation. Still best choice to play the games that are worth playing them.
dosbox~~~1271085473~~~Alexio~~~4~~~Many memories in one little box. Great for playing old classic games.
dosbox~~~1276419886~~~miez~~~4~~~Nice that I can play old DOS games on a Linux machine. Good old memories. Altough the sound is a little cracky sometimes.
dosbox~~~1279475759~~~changke~~~5~~~must have for gamers
dosbox~~~1281355753~~~hukoeth~~~5~~~Thanks to this software I could finally convince my dad to switch to Linux Mint since he can now run his old DOS applications.
dosbox~~~1282064769~~~factor-h~~~5~~~DOS was the base for what we take for granted. Fast applications and also the limited but clever games. This is a must for what DOS have allowed and delivered.
dosbox~~~1284084700~~~haxxorz321~~~5~~~dosbox makes up 70% of my game play.  classics like doom1&2, quake, wolfenstein 3d, duke nukem 3d, kings quest, etc. make dosbox indespensable for retro pc gamers.
dosbox~~~1284858515~~~talu56~~~3~~~would like it more if i knew how to use it :P
dosbox~~~1284935636~~~shiny11100~~~5~~~best way to play old classics
dosbox~~~1285003795~~~hazo~~~5~~~Awesome for DOS games.
dosbox~~~1294304926~~~LinuxGreen~~~5~~~Flawless. Although Amiga had better ports for a lot of Dos games
dosbox~~~1293638106~~~hexram~~~4~~~Revive the '80s video games out there
dosbox~~~1294724065~~~noman2008~~~5~~~Turbo C/C++ Language Working
dosbox~~~1295989123~~~smitty_the_smith~~~4~~~A must for dos games
dosbox~~~1296474471~~~SilasMortimer~~~5~~~This + the old shareware logic game Sherlock = just about the most fun I can have with a game.
dosbox~~~1296547751~~~MestreLion~~~5~~~A must for old gamerz
dosbox~~~1296752370~~~akash211~~~5~~~It is amazing, even windows 7 don't run Turbo C++ but now I am using Turbo C++ on Mint
dosbox~~~1299880501~~~Zer0~~~5~~~Great application. Get to play The Oregon Trail.
dosbox~~~1300070181~~~kunk~~~5~~~Fast enough for all the DOS games, multiplayer over IPX tunneling is fun too.
dosbox~~~1300638786~~~Ubutunix~~~4~~~gut für alte spiele
dosbox~~~1302644239~~~roguededguy~~~5~~~This + fceux + zsnes = the best games ever made playable on Linux
dosbox~~~1304858636~~~ashtoash~~~4~~~Oh my sweet childhood... Doom doom doom :-)
dosbox~~~1305724149~~~ZipionLive~~~5~~~dosbox runs flawlessly all my 90's oldies, and ironically works better on linux than on MS's Windows 7... Every retro-gamer should install this !
dosbox~~~1307441864~~~Argent~~~5~~~Couldn't praise this any more highly.  It runs 99% of old DOS games thrown at it with no trouble at all.  I do recommended using a frontend with it.
dosbox~~~1307545329~~~kad3t~~~5~~~DOSBox with DFend frontend is what the definitive Linux gaming is all about! :)
dosbox~~~1312116778~~~RavS~~~4~~~Works great. Comes in handy sometimes.
dosbox~~~1312386764~~~blueXrider~~~3~~~Emulator
dosbox~~~1314925098~~~registereduser~~~1~~~never installs. I click install then I type my password and it sits here. The install button goes away, it never starts.
dosbox~~~1314940658~~~newer~~~5~~~its save my life
dosbox~~~1316158250~~~dilu~~~5~~~very useful because it is easy to run turbo c in linux
dosemu~~~1273496193~~~Roin~~~3~~~Nice DOS emulator, not as good as DOSbox to run games, but great to run some old DOS applications ^_^
dosemu~~~1281973843~~~skretzchy~~~4~~~for me it works better than dosbox
dosemu~~~1308225090~~~greyebeard8550~~~5~~~Like to Play around with Land Of Devastation, an old bbs door game
dosemu~~~1312386853~~~blueXrider~~~3~~~Emulator
dphys-swapfile~~~1311217377~~~wyrdoak~~~5~~~I found it a great tool if you forget to add a swapfile to your install.  I was using Paint Shop in Wine and was wondering why it was running weird no swapfile, I forget to add one when I install LMDE been about a week and justr noted it. lol
dphys-swapfile~~~1314004640~~~iTophux~~~5~~~great tool for swapfile dynamic

dragonplayer~~~1310967665~~~ali20~~~3~~~its a good player
dragonplayer~~~1318549692~~~mintlinux~~~4~~~Even though I use gnome, it still runs perfectly. High quality sound and video.
drapes~~~1271592628~~~MintHat~~~3~~~It does a fair job with rotating my wallpapers. But it seems very random, I have over 150 wallpapers, some newly added ones I have not seen yet
drapes~~~1283328698~~~dme3ha~~~3~~~wish for less randomness in selecting my wallpaper. will review it for one week tough
drapes~~~1289608129~~~javedk~~~4~~~Works as intended. Though would like more refined control over changing wallpapers, plus an option in the right-click context menu.
drapes~~~1289904073~~~sirparker128~~~4~~~It is helpful little program.
drapes~~~1304261106~~~c1pr1an~~~5~~~cool
drapes~~~1308886512~~~crival~~~4~~~muy buena herramienta para gestionar tus wallpapers y mucho mas rápida que la tradicional herramienta de fondo de gnome
drapes~~~1310266592~~~Bocardi~~~4~~~This is a nifty little app.  My only gripe is that there is not a 'fit' option for dual monitors with different resolutions.
drapes~~~1312271504~~~linuxali~~~2~~~not bad but also not good
drapes~~~1315128888~~~linekin~~~4~~~ust works
drapes~~~1319577116~~~EderNauta~~~1~~~unestable

dreamchess~~~1284345213~~~Canmod~~~5~~~Impressive!
dreamchess~~~1285788602~~~kip-~~~5~~~this is something what i can play day and nite! its realy dream chess
dreamchess~~~1290834701~~~MINTE~~~2~~~Poco nivel de juego; en lo que respecta a los gráficos, parece que uno descubre cada vez más que las 2D son suficientes. Pero para gustos los colores, en lo personal nada convincente y poco funcional.
dreamchess~~~1291198526~~~Elisa~~~4~~~Good

dreamchess~~~1303958959~~~faishol09~~~4~~~good
dreamchess~~~1303961722~~~ZoltanBreller~~~4~~~Fine game, especially with "classic wooden" theme. On my machine, though, difficulty to keep resolution settings.
dreamchess~~~1304858795~~~ashtoash~~~1~~~How to do so. that the board has stopped spinning, I feel like throwing up
dreamchess~~~1306229065~~~Calensito~~~5~~~A ver si gano......

drpython~~~1306224201~~~kiwi3000~~~4~~~great tool
drupal6~~~1269760622~~~ddalley~~~5~~~Drupal allows you to build a CMS-based web site. It is very mature and well designed and it is set for a major redesign soon with D7. Most of the modules are completely free, not like with Joomla. Start with D6 because it is probably the CMS you should use first, if you need something more than just a blog.
drupal6~~~1294087844~~~szocskekutya~~~4~~~I like it
dselect~~~1304066688~~~B_Tide~~~4~~~i like this software!

dvd95~~~1311031731~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~nice
dvdauthor~~~1303253942~~~groovydaddy~~~5~~~Great CLI for converting M4V files to MPG files.  I then use DeVeDe to create an .iso file to burn to a DVD.
dvdbackup~~~1276055021~~~jajodo~~~4~~~My children have found they can slide a long way standing on 2 dvds.  Backups are essential for me and dvdbackup works surprisingly well.  Succeeds where Brasero fails and is much faster.  Copies to a folder rather than an iso.
dvdbackup~~~1277476796~~~huntman~~~4~~~good app.
dvdbackup~~~1295788270~~~silvergeko~~~5~~~excellent
dvdbackup~~~1295967931~~~5_O_Clock_Charlie~~~5~~~Works great ! Perfect Linux replacement for DVD Decrypter. No Gui, but one isn't really needed.
dvdbackup~~~1295984169~~~efthialex~~~5~~~Perfect
dvdisaster~~~1272271218~~~unexistance~~~5~~~Perfect application if you have a LOT of ISO images in keep :D
dvdisaster~~~1277167179~~~thx1138~~~5~~~DAS Programm der Wahl, wenn du deine Dateien langzeitarchivierst. Einfach ne Iso-Datei deiner Dateien mit Isomaster oder AcetoneISO auf der Festplatte erstellen und mit dvdisaster die Sicherung unsterblich machen.  OK, das Proggie legt eine zusätzliche Datei an, die 1-5% deines Archivs einnimmt (eine Recovery-Datei), aber dafür ist das Backup über Jahrzehnte wiederherstellbar.

dvdstyler~~~1317761705~~~Anleoje~~~4~~~Es bueno, pero te instala otros programas que para mí son innecesarios
e-uae~~~1267694905~~~gunni~~~5~~~installed this after problems with UAE, this works a treat!
e-uae~~~1312102673~~~Solar~~~5~~~Somewhat disturbing to see what these little buggers were capable of ten years before Win-95...

eagle~~~1277228114~~~vwgtiturbo~~~5~~~EAGLE is such a wonderful program for the electronic hobbyist that enjoys designing/making their own PCBs. Not to mention, it runs on multiple OSs, so no matter what system I am at, I can open my designs. I LOVE EAGLE!!
eagle~~~1298745415~~~dagon~~~5~~~Eagle is kind of unintuitive but has good linux support, lots of libraries and is probably the "no.1" program for electronic hobbyists.
eagle~~~1303957596~~~kjuergen~~~5~~~unfortunately nothing comparable available in FOSS. At the low price not a big deal and it never let me down in the past 20 years
eagle~~~1307152022~~~diegoCode~~~4~~~The best PCB design tool for linux.
eagle~~~1309977328~~~Ichag~~~5~~~Super Programm

easycrypt~~~1275123859~~~rappelkiste_src~~~4~~~Eine einfache Panelerweiterung für TrueCrypt Container (keine Partitionen).
easycrypt~~~1290545542~~~mcduarte2000~~~1~~~Doesn't seem to work. I wanted to make a simple task of opening a TrueCrypt partition and couldn't find a way of doing it...
easycrypt~~~1304273967~~~princeinflorida~~~1~~~Forget this. Just install the executable Truecrypt download from truecrypt.org and use it.
easycrypt~~~1304275440~~~wanda~~~2~~~Not a fan.
easyh10~~~1272476609~~~Alexio~~~4~~~This perfectly sets the database for the player so you can navigate using the native firmware, as opposed to using Rockbox, which eats battery power big time.
easymp3gain-gtk~~~1290631702~~~wanda~~~5~~~Feines program fuer alle mp3 sounds gleich zu setzen gleich mit install: wirt mp3gain - aacgain (mp4) und der vorbisgain. Es geht auch ohne de Gtk nur mit mp3gain via de terminal.

easystroke~~~1274797178~~~zens~~~5~~~This is the best application ever, I can't? believe they're not more widespread.
easystroke~~~1275120822~~~maliku~~~4~~~Greate application.
easystroke~~~1275841375~~~Yarrgh~~~5~~~Awesome application. Makes working easier, faster and more efficient. Everyone should try it out.
easystroke~~~1278315767~~~robertofmj~~~5~~~10 years using Opera Gestures.  Why not using gestures in the fully linux system ? This program is light, simple and f... incredible !
easystroke~~~1293996328~~~RobinJ~~~5~~~I've been using Easystroke for a while now, and I must conclude that it's a great little program! Only the tray icon is a bit useless, there'd better be an option in the configuration menu and the control center.
easystroke~~~1296885590~~~Townley89~~~5~~~Great little program that does wonders. A breeze to use, and being able to navigate websites comprehensively without shortcuts or having to click on nav buttons is a blessing
easystroke~~~1300128053~~~LusH_9600~~~5~~~Diese Gesternerkennung ist einfach genial gemacht !
easystroke~~~1301702187~~~Rockzalo~~~5~~~Lo instale por curiosidad, y me sorprendio bastante. Ademas sirve para sorprender a los amigos ;)

easytag~~~1279067772~~~dumpstar123~~~5~~~Good stuff!
easytag~~~1280017143~~~aneurysm1985~~~2~~~Sorry, but I couldn't get the hang of this one. The functionality was not intuitive for me - especially the strange icons that you have to hover your mouse over to understand what they mean. Am using the excellent free Mp3tag software through WINE instead.
easytag~~~1281904113~~~Jerome~~~4~~~Intuitif, pas besoin de lire la doc pour faire les actions essentielles : Changer les noms avec les tags ou constuire les tags grace au nom du fichier...

easytag~~~1288851214~~~Elisa~~~4~~~Cool!
easytag~~~1288936814~~~ClydeMachine~~~5~~~The 3-star average review is very inaccurate. This is a very good ID3 tag editor, does everything I need, self-explanatory.
easytag~~~1291436441~~~VaryHeavy~~~5~~~Realmente bueno!
easytag~~~1291533935~~~shaon121~~~4~~~i used rhythembox but this is better
easytag~~~1293090329~~~sojabob~~~3~~~The program itself doies it's work very well. Does not work on small screens, the GUI is not really intuitive.
easytag~~~1294546302~~~grim~~~4~~~Does the job, simple interface, smooth usage.
easytag~~~1295353185~~~DIONISIS_POLITIS~~~4~~~fully featured and ideal for mass tagging, but a little too complicated.

easytag~~~1306766430~~~jajodo~~~5~~~I am converting all my cds to flac and this is a great time saver.  There is a short learning curve though.  I recommend deselecting the option to automatically scan your entire music collection until you understand what is happening.  Then scan individual album directories until you get the hang of it.  If you are just editing one file Ex Falso may be simpler.
easytag~~~1307555538~~~jesvtm~~~5~~~Always useful, whatever media player you use.
easytag~~~1307808228~~~hungrid~~~5~~~Excelent app

easytag~~~1313681664~~~Jurandyr~~~4~~~Sinto falta de uma opção para transferir outros arquivos da pasta original (a capa, por exemplo), quando salvamos em outra pasta. É uma opção bastante útil.

easytag~~~1317655245~~~augusto_mint~~~4~~~After getting used to it (which can take some time), it's quite useful. I used it to tag all my MP3 collection.
easytag~~~1318700384~~~egabrum~~~4~~~The user experience is not the best, but the tool is loaded with features.
easytag~~~1319698905~~~inquisitor~~~5~~~best for mp3taging

eboard~~~1294964626~~~wdefender~~~5~~~Great program! Develope it...
eclipse~~~1273600907~~~clem~~~5~~~Great for big projects, especially in Java. For lightweight development I prefer Geany or simple editors (nano, gedit).
eclipse~~~1273818457~~~opensas~~~5~~~Ey!, it's eclipse we're talking about
eclipse~~~1274272965~~~alaak~~~4~~~Used it since 2004. Not perfect but imho the best IDE available. Most problems are due to some broken plugin.
eclipse~~~1274841670~~~SeanBest~~~4~~~Great IDE. Prefer Netbeans for Java, but Eclipse is great for creating Android apps!
eclipse~~~1275123713~~~maliku~~~4~~~???????????

eclipse~~~1275329223~~~jhrdka~~~4~~~Great for develop in multiple programming languages.
eclipse~~~1275646022~~~Tar-Minyatur~~~5~~~There was a time when I hated eclipse for being too complex and slow. Recently I learned to love it for taking so many annoying work off my hands.
eclipse~~~1275669477~~~yui72o~~~5~~~a nice and free IDE for java, C++, etc
eclipse~~~1275860670~~~opticyclic~~~2~~~eclipse is great compared to Geany and a compiler, however, it pales into insignificance when compared to Intellij IDEA. An open source version is now available (doesn't have the Enterprise plugins though) http://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/idea-ic
eclipse~~~1277927137~~~Melon_Bread~~~5~~~Best IDE For Android Devlopment
eclipse~~~1280005451~~~ledjin~~~5~~~The best of ready to use ide. But editor itself so so.

eclipse~~~1283166666~~~ekeko~~~4~~~everything fine, but waiting for Helios!
eclipse~~~1284494686~~~ozos~~~5~~~Best IDE for develop in multiple programming languages
eclipse~~~1286331334~~~Norv~~~5~~~It's a love 'n hate story for me and Eclipse... There are times I can't live without (take PHP step-by-step debugging with the awesome Zend debugger plugin...) and times when I hate its heaviness so much that I use anything else, just for being light, it's good to use something light for a change! From bluefish and geany to vim and nano. :)
eclipse~~~1289033830~~~nebjak~~~5~~~Great IDE

eclipse~~~1295340340~~~baljeet~~~4~~~Great for development using Java, loved working with it
eclipse~~~1295541402~~~JacobBiggs~~~5~~~One of the best IDEs for most languages. Don't upgrade to 3.6 for the while! Use it mainly for Java and Scala, but for general Scala and Java development use IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition instead.
eclipse~~~1296878593~~~ChirmiPlay~~~5~~~Es una de las más completas aplicaciones de código abierto.
eclipse~~~1297331278~~~hendra~~~5~~~nice
eclipse~~~1297457187~~~jkw~~~5~~~Combined with ZenCode, Aptana Studio and PDT it is a complete dream for a webdeveloper for the total cost of _nothing_!
eclipse~~~1298056066~~~kindjal~~~4~~~Best IDE for most languages but it's Galileo not Helios :(
eclipse~~~1298057629~~~Elisa~~~4~~~It looks nice but I don't know how to use it with the latest 'python3', can help anyone? Thanx.
eclipse~~~1298058333~~~wanda~~~3~~~No thanks gib mir lieber Nano oder Gedit is einfacher fuer mich.

eclipse~~~1302610847~~~Mitzh~~~3~~~good, but old version.. newest version > 3.6
eclipse~~~1302632800~~~roguededguy~~~4~~~Has some strange crash behavior, not quite so polished as Visual Studio, but it is indispensible for Android programming.
eclipse~~~1302944259~~~acpcalin~~~3~~~It is a good IDE indeed. It's made to be a Java IDE(a very good one in my opinion), but can with the help of some plugins be a Python or C++ IDE too. I don't like the fac that it is slow sometimes(loading for example) and that its interface is not a really great one(I'm reffering strictly to the menus). I recommend this IDE for any Java and Python programmer!
eclipse~~~1304061655~~~B_Tide~~~5~~~was my first approach to programming! I use iPhone and Android applications for us and I am fine! ^_^
eclipse~~~1304201309~~~mbnoimi~~~5~~~Awsome SWT IDE! it's working just like native IDEs

eclipse~~~1314269618~~~Bubba~~~4~~~It's done everything I've asked of it.

eclipse~~~1319551211~~~mareser~~~5~~~Great tool!
eclipse~~~1321590295~~~zkrony~~~3~~~nice
eclipse~~~1321990574~~~chassum~~~4~~~It's a big, ponderous, elephant of an IDE, but sometimes that's exactly what's required. Use it if you have no other choice. It does work well.
eclipse-jdt~~~1294695200~~~turbowei~~~5~~~good!
eclipse-jdt~~~1314998121~~~menon~~~5~~~hmm
edubuntu-artwork~~~1286346663~~~Xyie~~~2~~~This pulled in some nice themes and a background or two, but it overwrote some settings and I can't uninstall the package to fix it. Should have just installed the packages it pulled in.

einstein~~~1282902226~~~kameleen~~~4~~~nice leisure-time killer.  Easy, but still fun. (if you like sudoku-like games)
einstein~~~1283439220~~~kael~~~4~~~Fairly difficult if you limit yourself to using the information categorization on the board, easier if you keep track of extra implications on the side.
einstein~~~1295309405~~~HalfEvil~~~4~~~I've been looking for this game for awhile, its a great logic puzzle. This version has very unforgiving controls and uncomfortable UI.
einstein~~~1298819004~~~lobo32~~~4~~~nice logic puzzle
einstein~~~1307135764~~~Gabor~~~5~~~way better than sudoku
einstein~~~1312166168~~~Oppie~~~4~~~Straight forward deduction game.  Occasionally leaves you hanging at end of round a la 50:50 Minesweeper calls

ekiga~~~1278515809~~~Sentello~~~5~~~It's best to use. We use this to connect to betamax (nonoh, voipbuster, freecall, etc..) !
ekiga~~~1299359144~~~silvergeko~~~5~~~fantastic
ekiga~~~1300877784~~~sigurd1701~~~5~~~Just simply working and convenient

emacs~~~1281135541~~~silver~~~5~~~A remarkable tool which also edits text like nobody's business.
emacs~~~1282223606~~~NicolasRobidoux~~~5~~~Powerful, efficient and complex
emacs~~~1282549630~~~eurochriskelly~~~5~~~Steep learning curve before it becomes worthwhile to use but worth the investment if you plan on sticking with programming for a few years. Not installed by default on most systems so learn vi (or nano) too!
emacs~~~1282797912~~~kael~~~5~~~Like Eurochriskelly said, steep learning curve, but once you know it, you can do almost anything in it.
emacs~~~1283267986~~~bugz~~~5~~~Good highly customizable editor can be dramatically extended by eLisp scripts
emacs~~~1284428066~~~ozos~~~5~~~Best editor
emacs~~~1284911898~~~awshidahak~~~5~~~Emacs is one of the best editors that I've run across, simply because it is so extensible.  If you are used to emacs but familiar with vim, you can emable viper-mode to get similar keybindings.
emacs~~~1288499101~~~sigma-ml~~~5~~~Great text editor!  From time to time I do try other editors.  But, inevitably, I keep returning to Emacs.

emacs~~~1297098140~~~asedt~~~5~~~Learnd to use Emacs in scool programming C++/Lisp/ADA or anything else, it's ASUM, but for smaller edits I often use NANO in terminal or gedit.
emacs~~~1297515245~~~Le_Pat~~~5~~~Simply the best.
emacs~~~1297518446~~~hellangel~~~3~~~sooooooooooso~!
emacs~~~1301142600~~~jasonjohnwells~~~5~~~a text editor that is just about its own OS.  Org-mode is the the geekiest way to customize GTD with plain text.  Built in scripts to manage TODOs and time tracking within an outline so the actions are within the context
emacs~~~1301565071~~~farnaby~~~2~~~Well... if you want a geeky editor, why not use vim?
emacs~~~1312312607~~~changsijay~~~5~~~great!!
emacs~~~1314633337~~~trollboy~~~3~~~It's all right but there are many better editors
emacs~~~1317903335~~~perepe~~~5~~~The best

enna~~~1275430526~~~rocknerd~~~4~~~Works as advertised  under LM 9 Isadora AMD64. Lightweight and responsive, intuitive to use. Two complaints: Weather report for New York, NY? Can't figure out how to change, wrong location. Configuraton screen useless.
enna~~~1277010418~~~ritchnz~~~4~~~Remeber this is alpha. If you are looking for a simple media player that supports all media players then this has great potential as the "skin" for it. Suggest you learn how to edit the enna.cfg file and feedback into the GeeXbox community. The first seeting to change is the fullscreen setting to immediatley enhance the experience. Keep an eye on this one as it looks good.
enna~~~1286546595~~~zaenal1234~~~3~~~too heavy, for old pc.

epiphany-browser~~~1275750977~~~afterburner~~~5~~~fast, best and fastest usage concept
epiphany-browser~~~1275798717~~~Pariah~~~5~~~I'm hoping that as time goes by Epiphany will be developed more maybe a few more options because this is one WOW-fast browser..love it!
epiphany-browser~~~1276549396~~~huntman~~~5~~~very fast and gooooood
epiphany-browser~~~1276820353~~~funker2010~~~5~~~i love him!!
epiphany-browser~~~1280705652~~~genoskill~~~5~~~Just the browser I was looking for
epiphany-browser~~~1296572676~~~Inoki~~~3~~~Had to change my rating on this based on my long-time usage of this browser. I came to find it both pleasing and not at the same time, I'll explain why. The Pros are it's very light, extremely fast and comes equipped with most stuff you will ever need. The Cons are the following: bookmark management is horrible, seriously, this one needs a lot of improvement, secondly, it crashes a lot, has problems rendering a lot of webpages properly, has problems with text kerning and loading flash properly and addon management is not possible if you install custom scripts via Greasemonkey, you're not able to maintain, de-install e.g. and so on. While easy on resources and better than Firefox, faster than Safari, you might consider what I wrote before based on my experience with this browser.
epiphany-browser~~~1282148361~~~ivanovnegro~~~2~~~Nothing special, dont know why it exists.
epiphany-browser~~~1283498193~~~steven_gilbert~~~5~~~Its simple. But its so fast. A welcome edition to my browser's. If i need web pages fast its my nummber 1 choice.

epiphany-browser~~~1287952655~~~jhpassarelli~~~1~~~I don't like this browser. Very fast, though.
epiphany-browser~~~1288477535~~~Xyie~~~5~~~It's simple, it's fast, and it works splendidly on older hardware, much better than more common, heavier web browsers. It's also quite easy to use, and if you look further, there's extentions you can add. But sometimes, simplicity really excels over whistles and bells.
epiphany-browser~~~1295125193~~~Elisa~~~2~~~it's good just for really simple pages because a page with a bit more of javascript doesn't work... :-\
epiphany-browser~~~1289910944~~~Theologian~~~5~~~Very light, very fast, very unlike Firefox.
epiphany-browser~~~1290552783~~~Fuzzi99~~~3~~~It's better than firefox but not as fast as chrome, the best part of this now is it uses webkit not gecko anymore
epiphany-browser~~~1291481638~~~FunkyWhale~~~4~~~I gave this 5 stars first, but now it's 4. It opens a blank window that you need to close at each download and does not have a bookmarks toolbar. Other than that, it is very fast and supports Firefox extensions. God Job.

epiphany-browser~~~1294587661~~~Valthar~~~4~~~Very fast, very much a niche browser though that incorporates many hotkeys.
epiphany-browser~~~1294884034~~~ayearhasgone~~~3~~~The lack of tabbed browsing is a big let-down for me.
epiphany-browser~~~1295125094~~~wanda~~~4~~~Gut fur Netbooks , leicht und snell obwohl Midori auch sehr gut is.
epiphany-browser~~~1297230277~~~Martin_Lemke~~~5~~~So flott wie Firefox enst sein wollte.

epiphany-browser~~~1304811784~~~ashtoash~~~2~~~Not usefull

evolution~~~1284332348~~~MathiusQuest~~~5~~~I prefer Evolution over Thunderbird after all these years. It has everything i need to work with out of the box.
evolution~~~1285233053~~~AbeFreeman~~~4~~~Without this program, you "click to view appointments and tasks" on the toolbar and there are none.  With this you can add them.  At least the calendar part should be included in the Mint package.
evolution~~~1285671512~~~rob0917~~~5~~~Perfect alternative to Microsoft Outlook

evolution~~~1287823225~~~tamoghna4~~~3~~~Nice, but i like Thunderbird more!

evolution~~~1288119307~~~defcon~~~4~~~easy to use
evolution~~~1288968419~~~shimi~~~2~~~Calendar has very poor right-to-left support. Mail client doesn't work as well as thunderbird.
evolution~~~1289636122~~~Dinin~~~3~~~Takes long time to set up an account compared to thunderbird and sometimes it doesn't even send messages. The calendar and the contact function is good although.

evolution~~~1290473288~~~peter021~~~4~~~Funkar bra ihop med Google...
evolution~~~1291583037~~~edwardr~~~5~~~It's great for me because it syncs calendar and contacts with my Palm Centro, which I could not do in Thunderbird or Microsoft Outlook.  Email setup went smoothly.

evolution~~~1307442651~~~Argent~~~3~~~An outlook replacement but there are better apps and ways to do things.  Try Thunderbird.

evolution~~~1308954287~~~Andria~~~3~~~too heavy, too slow.....Thunderbirt is better
evolution~~~1309205368~~~bilbo~~~4~~~Nice and easy install, nice features with the address book and calendar.
evolution~~~1310770815~~~tpost001~~~5~~~Best mail program that I have ever tried.  Once you get the hang of it, you can do anything.  I import gmail, hotmail, roadrunner, and my company emails, and use filters to separate them.  Great contact list and creating a backup is SO easy.  Then use it to install on all your computers.
evolution~~~1310767545~~~psyckers~~~4~~~A bit sluggish, but has the goods where it counts for businesses.
evolution~~~1311518302~~~vonvalley~~~4~~~better than thunderbird for me
evolution~~~1311882622~~~yamm~~~3~~~Email client: Unusable on small screens, no folder options (cleanup, sound, templates etc), preview header to fat, ui not to user friendly. Just a little more than thunderbird. Not even close to The Bat.
evolution~~~1312554837~~~ksaylor21~~~5~~~Great integration with google's web services
evolution~~~1313115528~~~Labby~~~5~~~I love Evolution! It has a very clean interface, is easy to use, and has more features than Thunderbird.
evolution~~~1313771298~~~iTophux~~~5~~~very good client mail and calender
evolution~~~1316662509~~~notyourbuddy~~~2~~~Didn't work for me. When trying to setup an account's IMAP/SMTP settings it just hangs at "Please Wait: Quering server..". No progress bar, no errors, nothing.  Since there appears to be no way to setup these settings manually I had to go instead with Thunderbird which worked. (using Zoho: a lesser known email provider so this might be the problem)
evolution~~~1316721949~~~KeNaCo~~~4~~~Calendar and contacts are nice, but email client can be more automatic
evolution~~~1317649927~~~tedr56~~~4~~~Simple to use and to configure. My favorite over Thunderbird.
evolution~~~1318101005~~~Senlac~~~2~~~I'm using LMDE 201108 Gnome, just installed a month ago, Evolution crashes before it starts up, error message from terminal window says to repair Widget, gives web site. No success with that yet. There is always Thunderbird and the Google Calender addon is nice. But I wanted to try the group calendar functions.
evolution~~~1321648053~~~tigr~~~1~~~Oh, I hate it, the bloody thing. Who came up with the idea that the Gnome desktop absolutely must have Evolution in it? That guy needs to meet the clue bat urgently! I wish I could remove this silliness from my desktop without manual tweaks!
evolution~~~1322038570~~~adkalle~~~5~~~Simple to use and the absolute nr. 1

exaile~~~1275717896~~~Teucca~~~5~~~Shoutcast radio + many more
exaile~~~1272470167~~~Alexio~~~4~~~Quite an impressive media player, offers most features one would expect to find in any modern media player and also comes with a few interesting but not so popular features.
exaile~~~1273310574~~~caje~~~5~~~I like it more than Rhythmbox
exaile~~~1274223189~~~masoko~~~5~~~A complete media player
exaile~~~1274285568~~~Candy-O~~~5~~~Exaile should be the default media player instead of Rhythmbox
exaile~~~1274659901~~~crivote~~~4~~~Direct and simple to use, but powerful
exaile~~~1274901323~~~linuxpenguin~~~5~~~Not very sophisticated - but have all the features you need and it is better than Rhytmbox
exaile~~~1282005463~~~thx1138~~~5~~~Der beste Mukke-Abspieler unter Linux, der auch ohne Playlists das Durchklicken durch dein Datei-Verzeichnis macht. Internet-Radio ist auch drin. Wunderbar :-).
exaile~~~1275169883~~~rappelkiste_src~~~5~~~Sehr gute Bedienung und Funktionsumfang. Erweiterbar mit Plugins.
exaile~~~1275508719~~~crom~~~5~~~I loved foobar in windows but in linux i couldn't find nothing to match it. Exaile is the closest one. Should be default in mint.
exaile~~~1275621798~~~grhdtj~~~4~~~shoutcast radio
exaile~~~1276019096~~~JoSch~~~3~~~Library organization seems to be convenient and i liked the tabbed playlists, but it runs very slow and unstable on mint 9 64-bit in contrary to rythmbox which handles my music-library (120GB) way more faster and stable.
exaile~~~1276075443~~~lordnaastik~~~4~~~Slightly buggy but beautiful design and good features
exaile~~~1276228216~~~detechy~~~5~~~If you're looking for amazing radio station database, so this is it! And you can adjust volume or show Exaile, with one click, at tray icon, a must have for me. Try it..
exaile~~~1276354350~~~imeehow~~~3~~~Po przesiadce z Foobar2000 odczuwa si? sporo braków, np brak masowej edycji Tagów, do tego jest nieco oci??a?y i powolny.
exaile~~~1276805532~~~vassilev~~~5~~~best player
exaile~~~1278334410~~~galen~~~4~~~superb. getting better. lacks icecast support, nicer if it had an independant streamripper plugin for multichannle recording. see also tunapie, streamtuner
exaile~~~1278542587~~~Lopau~~~4~~~My favourite
exaile~~~1278799873~~~Twiguard~~~5~~~The best for came-from-Foobar users ... like me. And it's also green. =)
exaile~~~1279312301~~~dckjnsn~~~2~~~definately NOT a fan.  will not save my custom/manual equalizer settings
exaile~~~1279936696~~~goula~~~5~~~Personally, the best out there... it's the only one that really lets me drag and drop songs to current playing and doesn't have a million sidebars or top bars or however songbird, amarok and rythembox do it.. simple and the best!!!
exaile~~~1279972039~~~ivanovnegro~~~2~~~In my opinion too slow to organize large libraries and the scrobble function to lastfm doesnt works for me.
exaile~~~1281908452~~~JasonLG~~~4~~~Great music player.
exaile~~~1282461729~~~r1j1k~~~4~~~Fast & fullfeaterd jukebox. Nice one.
exaile~~~1283422542~~~randomz~~~5~~~Slim interface and nice library and tag management. Not the most fully-featured player out there, but refreshingly unobtrusive to use. Probably the closest you can get to foobar2000 on Linux.
exaile~~~1283427528~~~hamburn~~~5~~~For me it's one of the best radio player. The list of stationes is enormous. Just found with few clicks a station that plays jazz ;-)
exaile~~~1284138269~~~asymmetros~~~5~~~I do like it. I usually prefer simple music players (just select a folder and listen your songs) but exaile changed my mind. It s impressive as a radio player, easy to select stations all over the world, manage those selections in well organized tabs. Finally the layout is reasonable clear.
exaile~~~1284140340~~~Tracerneo~~~5~~~Great music player. Simply and easy.
exaile~~~1286250852~~~ceptor~~~5~~~i like this program. it is easy to use. plays your music or plays internet-radio

exaile~~~1289267911~~~Keeper_of_Souls~~~4~~~It's very nice, works much like the old Amrok of KDE 3.5
exaile~~~1290325543~~~French~~~5~~~Great music player,included a good working equalizer
exaile~~~1291247635~~~m4daredsun~~~5~~~My favorite music player. Simple to use, integrated equalizer, works with files and internet radio

exaile~~~1294455489~~~CriCai~~~5~~~La mejor GUI en reproductores de audio
exaile~~~1294872277~~~rel_dude~~~4~~~Love the layout! Finally a music player that is also a music manager without imposing an iTunes-like folder structure on my music library.
exaile~~~1295174705~~~samo~~~5~~~love it
exaile~~~1296730231~~~dbrian~~~5~~~Great music player
exaile~~~1297200539~~~Kein~~~5~~~Este reproductor es genial
exaile~~~1297285025~~~jjolumahe~~~4~~~me parece un excelente reproductor
exaile~~~1300195560~~~k273~~~3~~~Actually it got the best, organized UI. But buggy. Problems with updating playlists and reading audio CD artist names & track titles. Will be my music player when they're gone.
exaile~~~1301564774~~~farnaby~~~4~~~Decent player, just beaten by banshee.
exaile~~~1302383536~~~Germmare~~~3~~~... i use VLC ...
exaile~~~1304266070~~~guv999~~~5~~~Easy to use with a nice layout. Plays and manages your music very well, without a lot of unnecessary features found in Rhythmbox or Banshee
exaile~~~1305319667~~~kitzune~~~5~~~El mejor aun que me gustaria que se pudiera agregar los archivos de radio como pls automaticamente, pero muy bonito y buen reproductor
exaile~~~1306170288~~~busiq~~~1~~~freeez powered -.-
exaile~~~1306530499~~~linuxfanatik~~~5~~~I downloaded Exaile to Julia (Which I am still on) together with Firefox4 and Clementine (an early version of Amarok) but without the problems of Amarok. All of these items perform very well and are superb. Exaile and Clementine are about the best I've seen thus far with Clementine really excellent with the added noise generators which are effective with some types of music.
exaile~~~1306923457~~~RytronII~~~4~~~Nice music player.
exaile~~~1308651396~~~Richard~~~4~~~mais je préfère Clémentine
exaile~~~1310777712~~~Acyclus~~~4~~~Verry good music player, but i have a little lag at the start of the software T_T
exaile~~~1312595304~~~leonidas79~~~5~~~I love Exaile :)

f-spot~~~1276253722~~~vipek~~~2~~~I don't like this application. It has so weird user interface... If you want to attract new users, GUI must be consistent with the rest of the system.

f-spot~~~1292193576~~~kneekoo~~~3~~~I have mixed feelings about F-Spot. I heard good things about it and I'm sure those people were not lying but I tried to use it and I can't say I like it. Maybe if it was intuitive I would've explored more of it but I just abandoned it.

f-spot~~~1294346219~~~Wanderer~~~2~~~I do not like that it doesn't maintain my folders but organizes by date.  That is not good in my opinion.  Shotwell is a better program.

f-spot~~~1294536940~~~ebest97~~~1~~~Use Shotwell. 10x better.
f-spot~~~1294887901~~~simmy~~~2~~~I dont like the way it organizes, too confusing (for me at least)
f-spot~~~1294898743~~~JeanGrosJean~~~1~~~F-Spot doesn't cut it at all for me, neither does Shotwell. I just can't stand programs that organize my files for me, be it photo files, videos, music, documents, etc. So I use digiKam, the best and most efficient photo organizer/manager for the Linux desktop.
f-spot~~~1294899190~~~Elisa~~~3~~~Good
f-spot~~~1294946833~~~grim~~~2~~~Shotwell is better IMO :\
f-spot~~~1295080647~~~JOST~~~2~~~Starts then crashes, on my mint 10 64bit, i installed Shotwell instead, works great!
f-spot~~~1295792555~~~vesputs~~~1~~~really sucks
f-spot~~~1295876861~~~akash211~~~2~~~picasa is much better.
f-spot~~~1295927596~~~wilderix~~~1~~~launched it.  it started organizing my files into new folders.  then it crashed, and all of my photos were gone. fortunately, i had backups, but it made a horrible first impression.
f-spot~~~1296243542~~~gianpv~~~2~~~Picasa is better than this and easyer to use
f-spot~~~1296689347~~~Xyie~~~4~~~When it came down to either f-spot or shotwell for editing photos for someone I was helping, shotwell proved much easier to manage. F-spot is not a bad program in and of itself, however, so it's worth trying out to see your own preference.
f-spot~~~1296874009~~~bicyclist56~~~1~~~??????????? ?????...
f-spot~~~1297142430~~~flan_suse~~~5~~~Picasa for Linux is outdated, not native, and uses a shipped version of wine. F-Spot is better for Linux users. Just wish you can change the import naming scheme.
f-spot~~~1298700465~~~Twix2247~~~2~~~automatically organizes your photos into folders by date.  You can tag you photos to keep like ones together, say "vacation to Ireland". But they will still be filed by date.  It does have an upload feature to put your photo to Flickr or Picasa web which is nice, but then why not just use Picasa.  I didn't like how it automatically started to organize my photos into files by date.  I then had to go back and tag them, by event to get them grouped together to make it easier to view.  But maybe just a learning curve on how to use it, since I am used to organizing photos my way.  Will keep using it more to see if I like it and follow up the review
f-spot~~~1298805553~~~irbinix~~~2~~~????????? ??????? ???????? ???????????.
f-spot~~~1299187255~~~billymadsen~~~1~~~WARNING changed all the times and dates on my photos after importing.  Took a while to catch too,  noticed my son was born on the 12th instead of the 11th.  Rapid-Photo-Downloader is the best photo importer on any system; highly customizable and dependable.  Rapid and manually updated Picasa is great.
f-spot~~~1299467083~~~derschreckliche~~~1~~~ok, but shotwell is better (and has no MONO dependencies)
f-spot~~~1299847934~~~kukiduck~~~1~~~übelster Mono-Schrott
f-spot~~~1299848207~~~goodspeed~~~2~~~replace with shotwell or gthumb
f-spot~~~1299903427~~~mfy1992~~~1~~~???
f-spot~~~1300290565~~~Richard~~~3~~~sans plus, trop minimaliste à mon goût
f-spot~~~1300453528~~~bigbamboo~~~2~~~Came with Julia, not worth the simple trouble. Does not download videos from camera like Shotwell or Picasa. So I lost some just because I assumed they went and I erased the card. No error or missed messages like Shotwell.
f-spot~~~1302645360~~~roguededguy~~~1~~~What is going on with the way they sort photo dates? The folder structure this app creates is a nightmare.
f-spot~~~1302977055~~~FastFwd00~~~1~~~Crashes randomly!
f-spot~~~1303063154~~~mitanshugamer~~~2~~~nothing to fascinate. crashes randomly..
f-spot~~~1303955763~~~kjuergen~~~2~~~better no-mono programs available. Why do we need these "innovations" from M$? Gone together with Tomboy and the rest of mono
f-spot~~~1304106442~~~alextsr~~~2~~~Not really worth it.
f-spot~~~1304811653~~~ashtoash~~~1~~~Ugly
f-spot~~~1304891375~~~Martin_Lemke~~~4~~~Als Diashow brauchbar
f-spot~~~1305066288~~~turipriv~~~2~~~Totally useless. I really can't see why is still being installed by default.
f-spot~~~1305252793~~~akanashiro~~~1~~~Slow and it uses Mono
f-spot~~~1305488400~~~trollboy~~~2~~~Not great. Slow and clunky. Always immediately replaced by gthumb
f-spot~~~1305674472~~~tek_heretik~~~1~~~Laggy and crashes, Shotwell is far better, haven't tried gthumb
f-spot~~~1306302607~~~edtowens~~~1~~~Terrible app
f-spot~~~1306766938~~~jajodo~~~2~~~Prefer gthumb.  Photo organizers relying on databases have inherent problems.
f-spot~~~1307269562~~~900i~~~1~~~Mono - say no more.
f-spot~~~1308519295~~~UncleNinja~~~1~~~mono
f-spot~~~1309449773~~~wiltur~~~1~~~argh...this software is not practical, ugly, run run run !!!!

f-spot~~~1312233905~~~mintlinux~~~1~~~@blueXrider agree, gThumb is much better.
f-spot~~~1313065992~~~luxy~~~2~~~Not very useful

fbreader~~~1280058189~~~turin13~~~5~~~Wery good app. Read files in .zip, so you save disk space. A little bit slow on old machines. Have useful library with option to download books from within the program.

ffmpeg~~~1277766670~~~deathguppie~~~5~~~I couldn't do anything media related without this app
ffmpeg~~~1280409299~~~linXea~~~5~~~the back-end for all great media play-back basically.
ffmpeg~~~1291637482~~~elscripto~~~4~~~Not easy to master, but when you do, you can ditch for good all those other tenths and tons of eye-candy video/audio encoder and decoder tools.
ffmpeg~~~1294596340~~~grim~~~5~~~Essential.
ffmpeg~~~1306068449~~~wanda~~~3~~~Das kan VLC auch aber dan viel einfacher finde ich.
ffmpeg~~~1295183965~~~cybertriveni~~~5~~~It works as core of DownloadHelper converter in firefox exentions.have it for media converter!!!!
ffmpeg~~~1295511947~~~RyanBigDog~~~4~~~This is required in order to use the DownloadHelper add-on for Firefox. Must have!

file-browser-applet~~~1298157435~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Very useful to navigate folders you use files out of often, without having to open a file manager. Offers configuration for more than one folder, so you can limit or broaden its scope as needed.
file-browser-applet~~~1320649139~~~cirx~~~4~~~It's banal popup filebrowsing utility that should be available by default. Glad I found this at last, makes launching much easier. I depend on this parallel to gnome-do. Just the home item in the menue per default, so it will take up less space than the example picture suggests.
file-roller~~~1281469352~~~robertofmj~~~5~~~Read all formats. Xarchiver dont read iso. Its default of LXDE family :)
file-roller~~~1322266917~~~Inoki~~~5~~~Undoubtedly the best archive manager for Linux. Should be included everywhere by default, not just Gnome.
filelight~~~1272468108~~~Alexio~~~4~~~View disk usage in a different way than usual.
filelight~~~1275548562~~~AndrewX192~~~5~~~One of the best ways to find out where disk space went.

filezilla~~~1267751269~~~KevanV~~~5~~~great FTP and excellent support for remote editing files
filezilla~~~1272067282~~~jkw~~~5~~~Main software for me to handle all FTP-related filetransfers. I was used to Total Commander in Windows, but since none of  the Commander clones was even close to Total Commander I  had to grab a stand-alone ftp-client, and FileZilla was the best one I could find.
filezilla~~~1273081002~~~Dixie~~~5~~~Cool ftp client
filezilla~~~1273182003~~~Grundoko~~~5~~~This program is very important to me, and I love it. There is no FTP application I'd rather use. (Though it is a slight annoyance that you can't drag files to and from your desktop, even though you can do so on Windows).

finch~~~1300505069~~~Xyie~~~4~~~You will want to read the manual before using this, but if you use pidgin, but also spend much time in terminal, you'll find this useful. It's at least good to have on-hand as a backup...
findutils~~~1294463564~~~sigma-ml~~~5~~~Excellent and handy tools to locate files based on a large variety of conditions.
firebug~~~1267677280~~~serge512~~~5~~~best web developer tool
firefox~~~1270480963~~~clem~~~5~~~Very good browser
firefox~~~1271246455~~~Mdyter~~~4~~~good, customizable, safe... but a little too heavy in my opinion
firefox~~~1267665448~~~azathothian~~~5~~~the browser with the best extensions around
firefox~~~1267666417~~~SeanBest~~~5~~~Best browser around. And the addons make it that much better. Will never use a browser without adblock again.
firefox~~~1267675452~~~GhoS~~~5~~~Best overall browser, fast enough
firefox~~~1267677140~~~serge512~~~5~~~for me this is the BEST browser for a web developer, and all users
firefox~~~1267681046~~~speedyx~~~5~~~The key application to keep the web really free. Is the more secure, customizable, multi-platform that assure a comfortable experience on the web.
firefox~~~1267684641~~~HANAX~~~4~~~good, extensible, but doesn't feel "light" like Opera
firefox~~~1267710125~~~heltonbiker~~~4~~~It rocks when it comes to real pro web use, lacks a bit GUI design but nothing really serious
firefox~~~1267715077~~~akanashiro~~~5~~~It has improved its perfomance and has a lot of extensions
firefox~~~1267771146~~~mannuforall~~~5~~~Great browser with perfect performance to all type of sites.
firefox~~~1267840874~~~mmesantos1~~~5~~~What can I say about this browser, I know the best browser out!
firefox~~~1267885782~~~skeebo~~~4~~~Probably your best choice right here, awesome browser.. Just a little heavy
firefox~~~1268010562~~~conquerortim~~~3~~~Very heavy, lacks multithreading and not as fast as chromium or midori. However, it has an excellent feature set and does everything you want it to.
firefox~~~1268026363~~~nebcanuck~~~5~~~I've tried most of the main Linux alternatives -- Opera, Chrome, Epiphany, Konquerer -- and the only one that comes close is Chrome. Chrome has the edge in "lightness", but Firefox has such an array of features and add-ons that it ultimately is very, very difficult to move away from! One feature that I've yet to find in any other browser that is a staple of my browsing is Live Bookmarks.
firefox~~~1268159691~~~Richard~~~5~~~good, good, and personas it's cool ! Personas Mint ?
firefox~~~1268177897~~~ggolemg~~~2~~~dropped it for chrome, firefox is just a memory hog
firefox~~~1268227237~~~woockash~~~5~~~The best browser. Maybe not so fast as Chrome, but more stable.
firefox~~~1269085322~~~karanosov~~~4~~~good browser, only the memor usage is sometimes little bit heavy
firefox~~~1269356246~~~Khaled-Khalil~~~3~~~a good browser indeed, not bad
firefox~~~1316410625~~~XidCat~~~4~~~Like 6. The mobile version sux, wish they would fix that so I could fully use the sync feature.
firefox~~~1270926960~~~Roin~~~4~~~Big and nice browser, with lots of available plugins and goodies ^.^
firefox~~~1271225439~~~Napster~~~5~~~Firefox could be one of the most successfull softwares around, since the root netscape...
firefox~~~1271246340~~~SpideyWebber~~~5~~~FF 3.6 with personas is quite cool, and devv work on JS engines will bring it upto Chrome and beyond again...
firefox~~~1271295311~~~kunk~~~4~~~It works.
firefox~~~1271322640~~~captainhaggy~~~2~~~Der Firefox ist in die Jahre gekommen. Er ist wie ein Taschenmesser, das man mit Funktionen überladen kann, nur seine Hauptaufgabe als Messer (eigentlich als Browser), der kommt er nicht mehr nach. Nach dem Internet Explorer ist der Firefox in der Zwischenzeit der langsamste Browser.
firefox~~~1315738423~~~Rufus~~~4~~~Very good all purpose browser without any noteworthy weakness. Even on my small 10" netbook I prefer Firefox.
firefox~~~1271365798~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~Two things I don't like about Firefox: startup time and memory management. Except for that, I LOVE IT!
firefox~~~1271460005~~~Xtigyro~~~4~~~The best! However, Mozilla needs to better the design and the artwork of the browser.
firefox~~~1271590810~~~MintHat~~~4~~~It's not as fast as chrome, but it's still my fafourite
firefox~~~1273181878~~~Grundoko~~~4~~~Was once my favorite browser, bar none. I recently found Midori, and it destroys Firefox in my opinion, so I'm going to give Firefox a 4, where I gave it a 5 in the past.
firefox~~~1271707271~~~AlabamaHit~~~4~~~Google Chrome is a very quick rising star. They are making the Add ons (Well Exstensions) for them. They just don' thave that many for LInux version. Windows (my dual boot W7). I use Chrome, all extensions work on it.    Though Only things I don't like about FF is startup time. And the load when it hangs/freezes.. If those where fixed, there would be no reason at all to switch to Chrome. (Though chrome has  a very nice bookmark sync love that)
firefox~~~1271811544~~~maty1206~~~4~~~The only sin of Firefox is that it is heavy. Perfect web browser software, free and open source.
firefox~~~1271819492~~~gbrogan~~~4~~~Tried 'em all. Keep coming back to Firefox.
firefox~~~1272582049~~~linuxmint~~~5~~~Easily the best web browser. Always reliable and safe to use. Highly Customizable with addons, themes, and more!
firefox~~~1272889358~~~Hromin~~~5~~~Five Stars!
firefox~~~1273083663~~~Ainer~~~5~~~Firefox is my preferred web browser. It's free and open source, has a mature extension community, can be configured just how you want it, and doesn't try to track your every move. In terms of speed and memory usage Firefox is consistently highly ranked. When teamed with Ghostery, PwdHash, Adblock Plus, and BetterPrivacy it's hard to go wrong!
firefox~~~1273032937~~~awong~~~4~~~Most fully featured and functional browser.
firefox~~~1273060975~~~moorewarner~~~5~~~A great browser that keeps getting better, don't forget to view the extensions on mozilla.com, it's the best part of this great software.
firefox~~~1273159402~~~Obsi~~~5~~~Maybe not the fastest, but the most enjoyable, secure and customizable browser to use :)
firefox~~~1273212526~~~VICTOR360~~~4~~~Is not the fastest But Addons, reliable and safe to use.
firefox~~~1273273901~~~SDSys~~~4~~~El mejor navegador
firefox~~~1273498835~~~whaledove~~~5~~~My Favorite Browser
firefox~~~1273696102~~~Wolfdemon~~~5~~~Purely for the amount of addons
firefox~~~1273714033~~~alphazero~~~4~~~Firefox with additional addons like DownloadThemAll, TabMIx Plus, etc makes it more powerfull
firefox~~~1273717783~~~snowstorm~~~5~~~It works great!
firefox~~~1273719778~~~Gecko~~~5~~~Colorful tabs are helpful
firefox~~~1273818351~~~opensas~~~5~~~long live firefox, great for development, don't forget downthemall, xmarks, mousegestures
firefox~~~1273852392~~~begrebela~~~5~~~I like the private browsing so much and the popup blocker works good.

firefox~~~1274226559~~~skooal~~~1~~~so slow...
firefox~~~1274246707~~~nick~~~2~~~Slow compared to Chromium
firefox~~~1299038243~~~markavino~~~5~~~THE BEST!!!
firefox~~~1274269379~~~Ikkari~~~1~~~Really slow =(
firefox~~~1274271376~~~FunkTrooper~~~5~~~The awesome bar is such an underrated feature. I can't live without it.
firefox~~~1282320843~~~brettalton~~~5~~~Add-ons
firefox~~~1274277506~~~Emil~~~3~~~It's a browser. Plug-ins add functionality, but consume extra resources.  Ran slow on my slightly outdated laptop (18 months old).
firefox~~~1274282022~~~vadi01~~~5~~~very nice browser. definately a must to have.
firefox~~~1317167986~~~robertochile87~~~5~~~excelentes extenciones: ghostery y adblo
firefox~~~1274301176~~~M4t3us~~~5~~~Some may say it's too heavy and a bit of a knuckle-dragger, but it's its brute power that makes it the best. With an Extensive plugin database and an Open Source it gets the cookie in the browser war nowadays.
firefox~~~1274311283~~~tonsil~~~5~~~'The' browser!
firefox~~~1274387951~~~IOTA368~~~4~~~Since 3.6, a great change in speed! But I hope it will not transform itself in a tank like IE
firefox~~~1274437542~~~tohuwabohu~~~5~~~the browser with best addons
firefox~~~1274459016~~~parsamorpha~~~5~~~the best
firefox~~~1274520123~~~salli~~~4~~~well i prefer opera because of better apps
firefox~~~1274691123~~~majortws~~~2~~~I think there are better options out there
firefox~~~1274546152~~~Kitsune22~~~5~~~Chrome may be all the rage nowadays, but I think all always use Firefox over any other browser. There are many reasons for this, but the main one is customization-- what it lacks in slim size, Firefox makes up for in customization. You name a feature, Firefox has an add-one for that. From super-useful stuff like add-block-plus and the Firefox Backup Extension to simple things like FabTabs and Stylish, Firefox truly has something for every type of web browser. If you don't use your browser much, or use it primarily for Goodle Apps, the chrome might be the better choice-- but if you are on the web more often then not, the I think the Firefox is the number one choice.
firefox~~~1274819275~~~brad~~~5~~~best web browser ever
firefox~~~1274839196~~~sojin~~~2~~~It's a good browser... lots of useful add-ons...But I feel its slow and resource hogger compared to chrome. FF can't handle some sites with flash, but for chrome its child's play.
firefox~~~1274865752~~~Rimtotem~~~4~~~It's a feature ritch browser, lotts of addons and skins but it's on the sluggish side latly and i don't like that. On windows it slows my game performance :| wired.
firefox~~~1274871587~~~razernon~~~4~~~Good browser with a large selection of addons increasing it's functionality even further.
firefox~~~1275013630~~~thx1138~~~4~~~Not that fast, but the add ons make it great.
firefox~~~1275052385~~~cbeloni~~~5~~~the best! O melhor navegador, recomendo!
firefox~~~1275120034~~~AndrewX192~~~4~~~Great browser, but not as fast as chrome or opera. Almost endless number of plugins avalible for it.
firefox~~~1275127639~~~rappelkiste_src~~~4~~~Ein rudimentärer Browser, gerade in der Ergonomie. Stärken liegen in der Erweiterbarkeit durch Plugins. Alles Erdenkliche ist möglich.
firefox~~~1275147141~~~boballen55~~~5~~~Gotta love the extensions community.
firefox~~~1275165037~~~neut~~~3~~~Debian? Epiphany! Lighter, faster
firefox~~~1275242276~~~suman_linuxmint~~~5~~~really fast and secure... best web browser in world....
firefox~~~1313184587~~~grhdtj~~~4~~~Good
firefox~~~1275579373~~~mcduarte2000~~~4~~~Should learn some tricks with Chromium.
firefox~~~1275645851~~~Tar-Minyatur~~~4~~~While firefox has been and still is my browser of choice, recently I'm not too impressed with the performance. I totally rely on lots of addons though, which would make the transition to another browser painful.
firefox~~~1275662882~~~Pepa~~~3~~~Best best best
firefox~~~1275704734~~~noodle~~~3~~~Good, but kinda slow. Some of the plug-ins cause problems (x-marks, I think). The screen greys out and you can use it for a while.
firefox~~~1275798388~~~Pariah~~~4~~~Back when web browser choices consisted of Internet Ex;lorer and..um..yeah..it's gotten so bloated it needs a diet..too many extensions (yes, I am aware that sounds silly thanks)...performance and security just aren't what they used to be and what made Firefox so great to begin with..time to go back to square one I think.
firefox~~~1275871546~~~aibo~~~4~~~little slow, but still the old standby
firefox~~~1275883465~~~mattazooie~~~5~~~It's quick and efficient!
firefox~~~1275966994~~~kennethb~~~5~~~I still regard it the best web browser, though it is probably because i haven't tried many of others. It's overall performance uproared since 3.5, especially for the javascript support.
firefox~~~1275967480~~~rainserpent~~~5~~~My default browser on Linux!
firefox~~~1276039641~~~Spike941~~~5~~~The only real linux browser that works perfectly
firefox~~~1276045435~~~Graper~~~5~~~Muito Bom.
firefox~~~1276050098~~~pyronite~~~4~~~Stable, but give Google's Chrome/ium a try. I wrote it off at launch and now find myself installing it on every Linux distro I install.
firefox~~~1276194215~~~satanatam~~~5~~~Best adblock plugin. Works faster on Linux
firefox~~~1276205990~~~bagel~~~5~~~Reliable, fast and easy to work with. Less information-thirsty than chrome. Still better at displaying web pages than Opera.
firefox~~~1276269549~~~vipek~~~5~~~Great, stable, fast, adblocked browser!
firefox~~~1276360372~~~Sherbet~~~4~~~Does everything I need it to.
firefox~~~1276368539~~~IrishViking~~~5~~~One of the best web browsers out there.

firefox~~~1276868700~~~brianji03~~~4~~~This is the one browser that never crashed on me. However, I am not a fan of its startup time and having to restart the browser so much.
firefox~~~1276947195~~~ponpat~~~3~~~Like it, but currently not nearly as fast and stable then the alternativs.
firefox~~~1277035876~~~selekta77~~~5~~~Bester Browser
firefox~~~1277196186~~~kage~~~5~~~Long time user!
firefox~~~1277332777~~~Nottyl~~~5~~~Love my FF. I work from it, I get it tweaked to perfection with addons. Unbeatable.
firefox~~~1278633799~~~Twiguard~~~2~~~I use it when no other browser (Opera, Chromium, Arora) is working. Very slow at everything and takes lots of memory but there is also the whole bunch of plugins.
firefox~~~1277510055~~~ArcherSeven~~~4~~~Strong, reliable browser.
firefox~~~1309492141~~~Reves-Yosoy~~~5~~~Now using 5, Firefox just keeps getting better!!!
firefox~~~1277599555~~~gregt~~~3~~~been using firefox for over 5 years , love it
firefox~~~1277600998~~~onclipevent~~~3~~~It's OK but when G-Chrome came out, it couldn't stand a chanse.

firefox~~~1314279600~~~galen~~~3~~~long time user but it's bloated memory hog, serious security bugs, buggy, non authenticated plugins
firefox~~~1278626252~~~JSB2010~~~5~~~Nothing else will do.  It's fast, stable, and highly extensible.
firefox~~~1278633595~~~janijokela87~~~3~~~ok
firefox~~~1279036136~~~bobd07~~~3~~~I was a huge proponent of Firefox for years.The last few releases have been subpar at best.too slow and it has become a memory hog like IE
firefox~~~1279097064~~~Liszt~~~4~~~There are more light-weight browsers but really this is the most reliable. Many of the more light weight browswers fail to display all pages correctly.
firefox~~~1279156784~~~newchieng~~~5~~~I think this is the best browser around. Especially like the possibility of adding all sorts of add-ons to increase the functionality, ease-of-use and even improve security.
firefox~~~1299795085~~~wanda~~~4~~~Great sexy Browser ,great Add-ons.
firefox~~~1279248997~~~Fuzzi99~~~1~~~It's more of a ram hog than Opera, but i will use it when Chrome isn't around/have no choice (I would rather use IE)
firefox~~~1279316654~~~hezy~~~4~~~The browser. It has lots of good competition these days, but it is still my favourite
firefox~~~1279318814~~~dick~~~4~~~I find it works better than Opera on my computer
firefox~~~1279338707~~~mtnbiker72~~~4~~~Mozilla browsers have been my standard since 2002, and Firefox is a very good browser. However, it is getting passed by Chromium and needs to make some changes to get back to the top.
firefox~~~1279457984~~~jelnikar~~~5~~~Klasse!
firefox~~~1279463833~~~ivanovnegro~~~4~~~I think its no more the fastest one but I like it for the add-ons and the adblock works best with firefox.
firefox~~~1279547676~~~13thSlayer~~~5~~~The best browser in existance.
firefox~~~1279566072~~~Eric~~~5~~~It's been a dependable browser that never crashes.  I used it when running Windows.  I see no reason change now that I'm running Linux.
firefox~~~1279608492~~~Dejmon~~~5~~~Velice dobrý prohlíže? se spoustou funkcí.
firefox~~~1279920043~~~tgp1994~~~5~~~Should be on every computer.
firefox~~~1279995063~~~Celtore~~~5~~~What can I say? Firefox has been one of the many success stories in the open source community. It is fast, stable, and has many great additions for the browser to make it integrated for your preferences.
firefox~~~1280070959~~~Gothmog~~~5~~~Nearly the perfect browser: fast, acceptable memory usage and highly adaptable.
firefox~~~1280236637~~~thfechter~~~5~~~Ich mag den Firefox sehr. Flüssiges scrollen, zuverlässig sowie stabil!

firefox~~~1280370416~~~Apple~~~2~~~Not bad but seems slow and bloated.
firefox~~~1280377050~~~baffle-boy~~~5~~~best browser by far absolutely, no other browser has so many usefull addons. and little known fact, its faster than chrom if both have 3 tabs open and no add-ons. basically the fastest for peopel woith many tabs.
firefox~~~1280512275~~~CarstenD~~~5~~~Das ist ein großartig zu bedienender Browser. Allerdings ist er nicht der schnellste. Mit weniger Komfort, aber bedeutend schneller ist der Chromiumbrowser. In beider Hinsicht noch ectremer ist der Midori-Browser.
firefox~~~1280543225~~~enoW~~~5~~~good browser n plugin

firefox~~~1280712593~~~Abd3l~~~5~~~Nicceeeeee
firefox~~~1280973804~~~fridaynoon~~~4~~~Bloated but lots of plugin and good security. For me, google chrome still the fastest.
firefox~~~1281105200~~~dlkreations~~~5~~~Has everything I need for browsing. Has the best selection of and most extensive plugins imaginable. One of top favorite browsers of all time.
firefox~~~1281105593~~~Celtique~~~3~~~J'attends la version 4 avec impatience
firefox~~~1281253895~~~elscripto~~~1~~~Firefox to Linux is what is Internet Explorer to Windows.  The high degree of a distro-centric setup branding of the browser turns Firefox into a dependancy spreading cancer within any linux distro - a real maintenance nightmare.
firefox~~~1281446051~~~na5h~~~5~~~Great browser! Great plugins!
firefox~~~1281518600~~~mr_mint~~~5~~~the best browser...easy to use! change it the way you like

firefox~~~1281831245~~~xdunlapx~~~5~~~Excellent browser, easy to use and has tons of addons. Can be slow at times but overall a great browser.
firefox~~~1281831739~~~AcolyteVersion1~~~4~~~Brilliant, fast and extensible - one of the best browsers on the market.  Suffers from some bloat, and would be better without the distro specific branding, but a small price to pay for a fantastic browser.
firefox~~~1281992573~~~iclozm~~~5~~~Best browser and prepackaged in Mint.
firefox~~~1282107036~~~MarioLinux~~~5~~~El mejor navegador.
firefox~~~1282109527~~~Jac978~~~4~~~It's a good browser with a lot of plug-ins, but slows a bit.
firefox~~~1282411630~~~incogita~~~4~~~The most fully featured browser by a long way, mainly because of the plethora of addons to choose from. However, not the fastest or most stable browser out there either.
firefox~~~1282593953~~~Raven95~~~5~~~Wonderful Browser But I Prefer Konqueror
firefox~~~1282743953~~~Dragard~~~4~~~I've tried many other browsers, and I'll have to say Firefox is my favorite. Bookmarks are easy to move around, it's decently fast, rarely crashes, and customization options are great.
firefox~~~1282841633~~~jamahhaa~~~5~~~Simply the best browser around!
firefox~~~1282850416~~~cra1g321~~~5~~~May not be the fastest but the best overall IMO
firefox~~~1282851115~~~aprilland~~~3~~~The latest version is somewhat heavy. Older ones were better, alas.
firefox~~~1283024350~~~ArmandiuxGS~~~5~~~Sin mas palabras, el lider mundial en navegacion web Open Source.
firefox~~~1283343605~~~vilcoyote~~~5~~~I have solved a "bug" in Firefox 3.6.8.  The bug : When I was in a web site like a banking site for example, many windows were opened while surfing in the web site. When I disconnected my personnal space, a new window was opened but an active window kept opened. I really felt a security problem.  How to solve : You must uninstall Firefox and re-install it. I precise that Firefox was pre-installed when I decided to install Linux Mint.  Then, I thaught it was a Linux way to use Firefox but in fact it probably was a bug. So Firefox stays my favorite web browser.
firefox~~~1283321237~~~rabbihossain~~~5~~~The One & Only Safest Browser.......
firefox~~~1283347788~~~Paskal_07~~~4~~~great browser, the only problem is speed - chromium is much more speedy
firefox~~~1283448235~~~ckristi~~~5~~~By far the best browser outthere.
firefox~~~1283730160~~~MathiusQuest~~~5~~~Always been my favourite webbrowser. Best there is for my needs.
firefox~~~1283897012~~~mdowden~~~5~~~Still my favorite. Fast and Flexible.
firefox~~~1283928849~~~acpcalin~~~3~~~It is a leading browser, that's true. But the amount of CPU and Memory it consumes is much higher than that of Chromium. Plus, the speed of firefox is too slow as it's not based on webkit. It's just getting worse.
firefox~~~1283946422~~~nuremberg~~~5~~~It's faster and more reliable than Chromium. It seems to be the best internet browser no matter the o.s.

firefox~~~1284034243~~~kentw~~~2~~~Firefox have functioned well earlier , now it is slow for no reason , maybe my version 3.6.8 have problems .

firefox~~~1284050925~~~shwany~~~5~~~reliable, safe, fast and has a home button! excellent choice of addons, my all time favourite.
firefox~~~1284115656~~~ajhunt~~~2~~~Chromium the choice for me. Much cleaner and works beautifully
firefox~~~1284128285~~~leming39~~~1~~~Firefox is fucked shit.
firefox~~~1284128473~~~tanmays~~~5~~~The best web browser. They only need to restructure the UI like chrome/ium.
firefox~~~1284230276~~~hazo~~~4~~~Not great, but gets the job done. With the right add-ons this is awesome.
firefox~~~1284232765~~~simpleblue~~~5~~~Excellent rendering and a seamless experience. I find Chromium to be faster, but with ff's add-ons it's a big contender.
firefox~~~1284334572~~~Ross0_23~~~5~~~I Absolutely LOVE firefox, definately one of the best web browsers available, i use it on my Linux, Windows and Mac OS!!!

firefox~~~1285397465~~~abrasax~~~5~~~Best

firefox~~~1288050093~~~rmz81~~~5~~~the best web browser ever
firefox~~~1290992054~~~Deadite81~~~5~~~My favorite browser.  Period.  Highly extensible with thousands of free addons.  Firefox 4 is a significant upgrade and is on par with Chromium speed wise.  If you want "simple" (and glichy, it can't be just me...) perhaps Chromium is more your style.  For power users Firefox is the way to go.
firefox~~~1288181510~~~anguyita~~~3~~~no se escucha radios con extencion o plug in wmp
firefox~~~1288214561~~~30ctsparer~~~5~~~My #1 browser.
firefox~~~1288270790~~~Bryan~~~3~~~Firefox loads webcam websites that make other browsers crash, although I prefer the slimline appearance of Chrome & Chromium. I have uninstalled all except Firefox.

firefox~~~1288850811~~~Elisa~~~4~~~But it sux 'cos it sux a lot of RAM even I close some tabs :-\
firefox~~~1289134141~~~LeoGhost~~~4~~~I love the concept of FireFox, that it is Open Source and community backed. As an actual browser I prefer Opera, but FireFox does the job as well.
firefox~~~1289212115~~~Neck~~~5~~~Still the best browser around, with plenty of life saver addons.
firefox~~~1289308330~~~sigma-ml~~~4~~~Very good and stable browser.  I certainly recommend it.

firefox~~~1289342887~~~Keeper_of_Souls~~~1~~~Horrible web browser.. It's way to buggy and slow. Chromium, hell even Konquror runs better.
firefox~~~1289457396~~~synthz~~~5~~~Best browser and enjoy the cross-platform ablity, plus plenty of add-ons
firefox~~~1289646543~~~kenshiro~~~5~~~The top
firefox~~~1289702500~~~Elfo087~~~5~~~Ricco di estensioni, migliore integrazione con Delicious tra i browser esistenti, veloce, ma graficamente è meglio Opera, preciso nel supportare formati standard. E' sicuramente il browser più funzionale che esiste, specie per uno sviluppatore.
firefox~~~1289862780~~~borgesjrorlando~~~2~~~Worst than Chrome or even IE9, hope FF4 is better
firefox~~~1289777422~~~penguinuser~~~4~~~Not as fast as Opera and Chromium but has more extensions
firefox~~~1289815627~~~Montagnard~~~5~~~Despite late problems and competition I stay with this pionneer.  No others has so many Adds On for the good and the bad.

firefox~~~1291202362~~~tdockery97~~~4~~~Still the most feature-rich, even though Chrome is a little faster.
firefox~~~1291213575~~~blacx~~~5~~~the best, so far!
firefox~~~1291380013~~~Cable~~~5~~~I always seem to go back to Firefox, there's something special with it, especially now with Minefield (latest Firefox pre-release build), it really kicks ass!

firefox~~~1291656153~~~sonic4spuds~~~5~~~Love the extensions (especially fastest fox)!

firefox~~~1292172913~~~Poweradmin~~~5~~~Great browser
firefox~~~1292322653~~~oi_antz~~~4~~~Thanks for paving the way to standards FF, should you fix the memory leak, might consider reconverting from Chrome.
firefox~~~1292433728~~~Goden~~~3~~~It works as a browser and it has many useful plugins. Sadly however, I had to stop using it because it was so slow. It seems with each new release of Firefox (regardless of OS) it's getting fatter and fatter. It feels like it has memory leak issues.
firefox~~~1292461720~~~eppofahmi~~~4~~~very useful and almost perfect
firefox~~~1292605293~~~Holgi~~~3~~~Adobe Shockwave Player
firefox~~~1292732750~~~jamesm~~~5~~~Great browser,, sometimes acts quite slow to render as chrome does not. :)
firefox~~~1292987663~~~anfego~~~5~~~I love Firefox, can't wait for 4.X
firefox~~~1293303532~~~darkthorn~~~3~~~keep loading
firefox~~~1293473588~~~logicslayer~~~3~~~Firefox is getting too slow. Made the switch to Google Chrome.
firefox~~~1293478120~~~iry1989~~~4~~~could be faster
firefox~~~1293618835~~~dsnelson~~~5~~~Maybe not as fast as Chrome but still more than usable and fuller featured. Still best browser on the market for many reasons.

firefox~~~1294142163~~~oli123~~~5~~~the best you can find
firefox~~~1300407522~~~guv999~~~5~~~Firefox 4 is excellent - huge leap forward and up there with Chrome
firefox~~~1294871621~~~PERCE-NEIGE~~~1~~~One of the last version of Firefox, called Namoroka crashed very often, and now the newer version Minefield is even more buggy. I don't trust Mozilla anymore, they seemed to be so serious in the past. And now, a very slow browser, I think the genius Mozilla is dead.
firefox~~~1294242101~~~TJGeezer~~~4~~~Firefox is flexible, with terrific extensions.
firefox~~~1294345951~~~Wanderer~~~5~~~Hands down, favorite.  Extensions and the ability to make it look and feel like I want keeps me coming back after trying the others.
firefox~~~1294687373~~~Porkchop62882~~~4~~~It's second best, Chromium is much faster.
firefox~~~1294448889~~~grim~~~5~~~Amazing and featureful! Nuf said...
firefox~~~1294498979~~~DrakVLA~~~5~~~My favourite browser!
firefox~~~1294578149~~~dramez~~~5~~~Best browswer ever! Great add-ons!
firefox~~~1294581301~~~efthialex~~~5~~~It's irreplaceable
firefox~~~1294773570~~~jmmzon~~~3~~~Firefox is my favourite web browser but I'm wait for stable Firefox 4. Third is to slow.
firefox~~~1294871856~~~Qruqs~~~4~~~Has become a RAM hog, but I still like it.
firefox~~~1294922573~~~DIONISIS_POLITIS~~~4~~~good, extentable, but not the quickest
firefox~~~1295044151~~~joix~~~5~~~Firefox is very good web browser. Try it with add-ons!
firefox~~~1295083183~~~LoboPops~~~4~~~Still having problems with 64 bit flash plugin
firefox~~~1295090919~~~itricker~~~2~~~It's OK, but Chromium is much faster!
firefox~~~1295146292~~~OverTheHill~~~4~~~Even though Chromium may be faster, I prefer FireFox
firefox~~~1295176622~~~cybertriveni~~~5~~~fast,customizable and supports all language well
firefox~~~1304262077~~~lukyjay~~~2~~~Its okay, Chromium is faster and better looking.
firefox~~~1295353904~~~simmy~~~3~~~ok i guess, but never liked the history (netscape) so its always remained rather plain and ugly to me, but if thats not an issue..it works fine..and has tons of plugins, however finding and using the less buggy ones, is a trial and error sort.
firefox~~~1295401356~~~roloram~~~5~~~my favourite browser
firefox~~~1295401915~~~JeanGrosJean~~~2~~~I used Firefox a long time, and liked it then, but three years ago I discovered Opera and as far as I'm concerned Opera beats Firefox hands down.
firefox~~~1300545263~~~nipunsharp~~~5~~~THe best. Lot of options, configurable. Chrome does not have 1/10th the configurablility of firefox. The only difference i have seen is chrome is faster on start up becasue it has less options.
firefox~~~1295478626~~~kindjal~~~5~~~The best one ! Even better when 4 will be released
firefox~~~1295578661~~~MintyJay~~~4~~~I like it, very easy to customize. I like the content blockers that it has such as foxfilter.  It is a bit slower than chromium, but I can live with that.  I also like what I have seen of the 4.0  beta.  I think the performance will improve.
firefox~~~1295771474~~~andrew5859~~~5~~~Great browser, easy to use and customise...heard a lot about 4, but haven't figured out how to install it through terminal
firefox~~~1295809888~~~nicu~~~4~~~Second best after Chromium
firefox~~~1295986116~~~smitty_the_smith~~~5~~~Best web browser EVAR
firefox~~~1296227451~~~mainframef4~~~5~~~May not be as fast as Chrome at times, but hands down for best add-on and plugin support for fine tuning every aspect.

firefox~~~1296495896~~~flan_suse~~~4~~~Not the fastest or lightest, but Firefox shines with its unmatched number of excellent addons.
firefox~~~1296498161~~~mikefreeman~~~5~~~I switch equally between this and Chromium, depending on my needs at the moment. Both are great!
firefox~~~1296806159~~~piku2008~~~4~~~Great browser.............
firefox~~~1296894993~~~sijtom0703~~~5~~~Decent browser...provides all decent features required for a browser and plus some stupid addons :)
firefox~~~1296917522~~~bboydp~~~3~~~Firefox might be safe, but compared to Google Chrome, it is a tad slow, and I am a speed hog.
firefox~~~1297097338~~~asedt~~~5~~~I like Mozilla and I like Firefox, use this as default. One of the best browsers, but there are other good ones to.
firefox~~~1310818191~~~burjans~~~5~~~Try with Firefox 7 and you will see what is a browser
firefox~~~1316010350~~~komodo169~~~2~~~Use to be my favorite until Chrome...too slow on the start up and is going the way of IE...also, fonts are way to small for me to read and anytime I try to adjust fonts in preferences or use an add on to adjust them it just screws up the web page.  Too bad - 2*'s only
firefox~~~1297216695~~~cmaew04~~~5~~~Love all the options. Significant speed improvement from IE. I still prefer firefox over chrome because of all the plugins and addons that firefox offers.
firefox~~~1297592389~~~mudslinger~~~5~~~with use of some addons like noscript and downthemall - it makes for a good robust browser
firefox~~~1297593421~~~jkw~~~5~~~A must have as a webdeveloper since the majority of the web uses Firefox nowadays.
firefox~~~1298186195~~~rubul~~~3~~~But its RAM hungry,im using opera,

fldiff~~~1275538009~~~opticyclic~~~1~~~Old looking. Not sure what toolkit it uses. Functionally deficient compared to Meld and Diffuse
fldigi~~~1287524034~~~jgerry~~~5~~~Excellent program
fldigi~~~1298429138~~~k8wdx~~~5~~~Simply the best, no competion
fldigi~~~1315386618~~~g3zxx~~~4~~~Does what it says on the box.  Installed without problem.  Having finally ditched Windows, I'm having to find replacement Amateur Radio software that will run on Linux, not all that easy to do, in some cases, but this one seems to run OK.
flex~~~1296053170~~~fafoy~~~4~~~good
flickrfs~~~1299423888~~~vinnn~~~5~~~Works a charm and comes with a good man page. Install the package, add your user to the 'fuse' group and run flickrfs with your mountpoint as an argument, Flickr will pop up in your browser so you can authorise flickrfs' access. Voila you can drag and drop jpgs to and from you flickr account. Copying a directory full of photos into the 'sets' subdirectory creates a new set containing your photos. Amazing!
flight-of-the-amazon-queen~~~1270475391~~~clem~~~5~~~Very fun game. Old but fun.
flight-of-the-amazon-queen~~~1270989277~~~Roin~~~5~~~I love this game. Its one of the few games that are really worth playing them.
flight-of-the-amazon-queen~~~1279642674~~~telewatho~~~5~~~Witty, fun and very addictive. Feels rewarding when you complete a puzzle
flight-of-the-amazon-queen~~~1288513607~~~Boringbytes~~~2~~~This game looks like it might be fun, but doesn't work on my mint 9 computer. The total lack of help files makes it impossible to know why.There should be in game clues to tell players what  to do, but if they're there they arent obvious...or maybe the same thing that prevents controls from working properly is interefering with them. I hoped this game would help put the lie to the common conception that there are no good games for linux...but it defintately didn't. I May revise my opinion later, but for now I can't reccomend this game.
flight-of-the-amazon-queen~~~1292529431~~~mockturtl~~~4~~~see also: beneath-a-steel-sky
flight-of-the-amazon-queen~~~1296477774~~~SilasMortimer~~~3~~~If you're an adventure game fan and have played all the greats, you'll be disappointed with this. The dialog is awkward and hackneyed, the puzzles are rather obvious (there isn't one that really makes you stop and think), and overall it seems it was an attempt to match up with the good ones without the talent to make it as good. You can find better stuff on AGS.
flight-of-the-amazon-queen~~~1298942782~~~Draco~~~4~~~Good game, very long..and quirky dialoge and game play...i have to addmit that i had to use a walkthrough every now and then...stupid me..?!?!?!?!?
flight-of-the-amazon-queen~~~1308510646~~~WOLF67~~~4~~~great game

flightgear~~~1279096109~~~blue70s~~~3~~~I miss Total Air War from DID
flightgear~~~1281576818~~~thx1138~~~5~~~Einfach nur herumfliegen (mit professionell nachgebildeten Cockpits verschiedener Flugzeug-Typen), ohne jemanden töten/etwas zerstören zu müssen. Schöne Grafik, erweiterbar.
flightgear~~~1282427840~~~pilot824~~~4~~~Its not like Microsoft's Flight Simulator X, but it will do for Linux
flightgear~~~1282769096~~~TheCirrusTechnique~~~4~~~X-Plane for Linux is more developed, but this is still a great sim.
flightgear~~~1283945638~~~nuremberg~~~4~~~Great Alternative to FSX!
flightgear~~~1292173212~~~Trinexx~~~3~~~Not as good as FSX (or FS9), but still remotely enjoyable. Good choice if you're short on money.
flightgear~~~1297873714~~~DrEvil~~~1~~~Is this a flight sim? O.o'''
flightgear~~~1297880040~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~The interface is very lacking in usability, but as far as flight physics and graphics, it's a great program!
flightgear~~~1298429688~~~elijlyn~~~4~~~Mint users try "fgo" for a GUI, would of been a 5 except the repository  has version 1.9.1  which is not the current release > 2.0. It is nearly impossible to complie the source, most likely the reason we are at a lesser ver...but still an awsome sim, I have flown actual Cessina 170-180...
flightgear~~~1308876528~~~KaJDaSilva~~~3~~~It could be better!
flightgear~~~1310314815~~~tomcamish44~~~1~~~Showed startup screen then crashed and wouldnt close (not my computer causing it).
flightgear~~~1311653705~~~Jerry1999~~~3~~~Looks good,but how to use other plane?
flightgear~~~1313651957~~~gregyboy234~~~3~~~nice.....but getting other planes is a pain in the bum.
flightgear~~~1319121965~~~galen~~~5~~~bumping up to counter idiot reviews. Sim requires 3D enabled video card
flite~~~1320847499~~~chassum~~~4~~~handy command-line text to speech application. Useful for using in bash scripts, etc. I prefer its vocalization over that used in espeak.
flobopuyo~~~1274319547~~~bblonski~~~5~~~Excellent Puyo Puyo clone
flobopuyo~~~1276776878~~~vipek~~~5~~~It's really good. It's a tetris-like game, but I think it's better than tetris :)
flobopuyo~~~1291500190~~~kip-~~~4~~~better then tetris...
flobopuyo~~~1295199397~~~Jac978~~~4~~~Great game.

flpsed~~~1306505330~~~pedherall~~~5~~~Programa muy ligero para anotar en pdf
flpsed~~~1311017400~~~JackWelch55~~~5~~~Excellent PDF Typewriter software!
flpsed~~~1312166767~~~princeinflorida~~~3~~~Nice PDF typwriter.  Good form filler for a page or two but not much more. Display and controls are clunky. Somewhat degrades the screen display.  On longer forms the file size becomes too large to open again.
flpsed~~~1320428373~~~Ayaguaska~~~4~~~Un poco basico, pero para rellenar formularios en pdf es perfecto: sencillísimo y muy ligero.
fluxbox~~~1281805905~~~stimuli~~~5~~~This window manager is full of win! Recommended.
fluxbox~~~1284099865~~~wasp~~~5~~~Very lightweight and elegant !!
fluxbox~~~1284953838~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Lightweight and not too terribly hard to configure. Might take some config file editing, but doesn't always have to. Even when it does, it's simple enough to figure out. Great for a speedy, clean desktop that is light on resources, and easy to make your own. Adventurous beginners welcome!
fluxbox~~~1298058190~~~sayan_acharjee~~~4~~~great look and easily configurable =]
fluxbox~~~1300016618~~~ihends~~~1~~~just hate it
fluxbox~~~1307313674~~~Tomas_IV~~~5~~~Just love it. Great for handling big number of windows and multi-window apps (GIMP etc..), since it can remember window position and/or size , or stack windows into one with tabbed interface. But it takes time to understand what it is about. Please do *not* review after few hours or days of testing, if everything you used so far is a desktop environment like Gnome/KDE/XFCE.
fluxbox~~~1314650130~~~iTophux~~~5~~~very light, very speed, very low memory, very well
fluxbox~~~1315164393~~~vrkalak~~~5~~~I started using Openbox (also initially based on Blackbox) about 2 years ago. Within the past year, have come to love Fluxbox. I have found Fluxbox to be easier to use and configure than Openbox. Fluxbox is apparently - Blackbox "done right"

fontforge~~~1288297713~~~-and-~~~5~~~Just great
fontforge~~~1294875993~~~Qruqs~~~2~~~Editing is far too cumbersome to make it useful for this. I prefer exporting the glyph so I can edit in Inkscape.

fp-ide~~~1301993378~~~trash~~~5~~~Free Pascal rocks.  Perfect if you ever used any of the old turbo pascal tools.
fpc~~~1270921805~~~Roin~~~5~~~My favorit Pascal compiler, it contains bindings and wrappers for the most popular C libaries on linxu and even adds some own stuf. Great compiler.
fpc~~~1273226070~~~ej64~~~5~~~I'm coding my little helpers in Pascal since ages. Coming from DOS/Win16 I began with TurboPascal and switched years ago to FPC. Porting was easy and sometimes not even necessary to compile a 32bit exe. Porting sources to Linux may be more tricky. Compilations are fast and stable. I love FPC
fpc~~~1280270016~~~digimaus~~~5~~~I've been using Pascal since 1987 and FPC is essential in today's environments.
fpc~~~1294775669~~~jmmzon~~~4~~~Pascal -- it's make reader laugh but I must use it in school and FreePascal is the best in the Pascal compiller. IDE is look like original TurboPascal but is better and have better performance.
fpc~~~1297789331~~~exxxon~~~5~~~The nice compiler!!!
fpc~~~1310516184~~~dscapuano~~~5~~~Always was a great language.  This is good stuff when combined with Lazarus.

freeciv-client-gtk~~~1276206415~~~bagel~~~5~~~Great game with strong AI.
freeciv-client-gtk~~~1276809204~~~Xyie~~~5~~~Addicting strategy game with good graphics and an easy to use interface. Sounds are optional, I see this as a plus.
freeciv-client-gtk~~~1279283787~~~ManOfKent~~~5~~~Really great work, nicely done
freeciv-client-gtk~~~1279767939~~~Rayden~~~5~~~freeciv is based on the legendary game, so it is very good
freeciv-client-gtk~~~1280629214~~~timloyal~~~1~~~cumbersome at times. Hard to follow the game play.
freeciv-client-gtk~~~1284639263~~~linux1492~~~5~~~Great game - time consuming and challenging strategy game - can recomment it
freeciv-client-gtk~~~1287232763~~~elscripto~~~4~~~Highly customizable, although the equivelent Civilization II, aged nearly 15 years, is more fun to play.
freeciv-client-gtk~~~1288654475~~~brucemuggins~~~4~~~So addictive! Lacks music and animation, but still heaps of fun.
freeciv-client-gtk~~~1296344481~~~donuthater~~~5~~~A beautiful Civ! Would be nice if there was a full map view

freeciv-client-gtk~~~1307545136~~~kad3t~~~5~~~Amazing! The best Civ II clone out there... Only wish they would add some features from Civ V and that would be most likely the best free game of all! :)
freeciv-client-gtk~~~1322094683~~~brannyh~~~5~~~A fantastic game, can be complicated for beginners though.
freeciv-client-sdl~~~1281694985~~~arubislander~~~4~~~Great for small screens

freedoom~~~1296481283~~~SilasMortimer~~~4~~~At times, it's a bit too derivative, though I suppose that's the point. Nevertheless, it's nice that it's available.
freedroidrpg~~~1298808789~~~lobo32~~~5~~~The best free RPG I have seen so far!
freemat~~~1284227980~~~Heladocaliente~~~5~~~Best mathematics framework. It is the fastest. Very responsive, it is written in Assembly, Fortran and C. It is true that the scripting is most compatible with Matlab.
freemat~~~1292615801~~~hexram~~~5~~~Impressive speed and good compatibility with others
freemind~~~1273065716~~~moorewarner~~~5~~~A great mind-mapping/organizational tool. My favorite concept mapping software.

freemind~~~1311492230~~~bugz~~~5~~~Outstanding program to structure our knowledge areas. I had efficiently used that in both in my new projects on work (to put any knowledge i.e. team structure and responsibilites, servers layout in one place) and in personal businesses.

freemind-browser~~~1319233802~~~new2nix~~~4~~~Best Mind mapping software period. VYM looks like a sad knock-off compared to this. Helps me organise large projects into more specific steps.

freetennis~~~1287750758~~~strider~~~3~~~I really hope this gets updated as it's really not a bad game. Some aspects are quite frustrating, but once you learn a few moves it can be quite good fun. Not a bad game overall.
freetennis~~~1302447971~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~easy to use, just with the click of a mouse.

frostwire~~~1284383695~~~fenerbahce~~~5~~~This is the best...
frostwire~~~1284526082~~~inktitan~~~4~~~very biggy. always want vlc for preview
frostwire~~~1284545590~~~Cougar~~~4~~~The p2p network that Limewire operates on is the second most poular, after BitTorrent of course.  Any program that makes that network open to linux users with a half decent interface deserves a medal
frostwire~~~1284645017~~~AbeFreeman~~~5~~~Just as good as limewire but loads much faster.
frostwire~~~1286554828~~~zaenal1234~~~1~~~too heavy for old pc, oftentimes hang/crash, late to close/restart.

frostwire~~~1291649900~~~Dave68~~~4~~~I recently picked up the .deb package off of the Frostwire Site. Current release is 4.21.1 I believe. I have had no issues to date on this Software, and wonder why it hasn't made it in to the Repos yet. Excellant program. Search feature is great for singles, not so good with Albums.

frostwire~~~1301621221~~~TrinityDan~~~5~~~Great software once you learn to spot bad torrents.  Use IPBlock to protect your privacy when dling torrents with Frostwire as you will get a lot of malicious hits!

frozen-bubble~~~1296549264~~~Boringbytes~~~4~~~A simple, enjoyable game with better than usual graphics. You fire frozen bubbles from an ice cannon, and they're sticky...so watch your aim.
frozen-bubble~~~1288636219~~~frankeinstein~~~4~~~Good game and great time killer. I have lost many hours playing this, when I only intended to kill a few minutes.
frozen-bubble~~~1288675848~~~Xyie~~~4~~~This game is pretty high quality, but some settings are hidden, accessible only by hotkeys, such as the ability to mute sounds or turn off the music. This honestly should be graphically accessible if only with a page that shows which key to press. I consider this a critical missing feature for the user. Otherwise the game is really fun!

frozen-bubble-data~~~1288510080~~~Boringbytes~~~4~~~This is not a "clone" of any other game I ever played.  You fire frozen bubbles from an ice cannon, but they're sticky...so watch your aim. You need these data files so get them when you install the game for the first time.  Simple game play, enjoyable , better than usual graphics for a linux game.

fusion-icon~~~1282585712~~~Xyie~~~4~~~This lets me switch window managers easilly, regardless of whether or not I have my nvidia driver to be able to run compiz. It allows me use Xfce's window manager under GNOME whenever I want to. Careful if you switch to Icewm with it and then use Icewm to switch to fluxbox. I got stuck that way and had to log out to fix it.

geeqie~~~1294875840~~~Qruqs~~~5~~~Very nice indeed.
geeqie~~~1302293148~~~k273~~~4~~~Nice modifiable interface. Though light, can display a thorough property of images; full screen slideshow capability is also an advantage compared to gthumb. Slightly slow rendering thumbnails for the first time when opening folders containing pictures.
geeqie~~~1318079031~~~asymmetros~~~5~~~Extremely fast and lightweight, easy to use: just turn the mouse wheel and the next photo is there. Also, integrates some extra features too: analytic exif information, pan view, etc

gexec~~~1296986307~~~bitlz~~~5~~~best launchy like tool for linux
gextractwinicons~~~1283721979~~~scorici~~~5~~~In windows I've used Any2Icon, and this is exellent to me because I need Icons from .exe for a image to a its launcher. Because I still use some software in wine , chess software that is. :) Great.
gextractwinicons~~~1304195656~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Works very well to get icons out of files. There's some minor features I wish this tool had, but it gets done what it claims very easily and very well.
gextractwinicons~~~1312450305~~~MestreLion~~~5~~~AMAZING little app! Easily extracts icons from EXEs and DLLs. Read groups and individual icons, save in PNG and ICO, preserving all attributes in filename. VERY helpful

gftp~~~1279565556~~~tgp1994~~~4~~~Nice.
gftp~~~1280362759~~~erictully~~~5~~~nice and stable.  love it.  used it for years.
gftp~~~1284043615~~~pbmuk~~~2~~~Doesn't connect sometimes when other FTP clients work fine. Lots of issues with the interface. Can't turn off top connection bar. Not obvious how to save passwords for bookmarks. If you disconnect from local location then it's not obvious how to reconnect.
gftp~~~1287423862~~~SimonPage~~~4~~~Works well. No problems.
gftp~~~1289205988~~~XeroXer~~~5~~~Most of the time I use lftp but when I feel the need for a GUI gftp is what I turn to. Great FTP client...

gftp~~~1299678952~~~christomaria~~~4~~~I just used it now and it seems I would prefer FileZilla! But its still cool though!
gftp~~~1318121310~~~obakfahad~~~5~~~Best......And absoluately better than filezilla.
gftp~~~1309108157~~~bilbo~~~5~~~Easy install, connecting to server no problems.
gftp~~~1310760348~~~tpost001~~~5~~~Can't live without it.  Together with vsftp (server) works great to transfer files from one pc to another in your network and over the web.  Who needs a cloud when you can use gFTP/vsftp?
gftp~~~1313166659~~~Terryphi~~~1~~~Messed up permissions on my server when I tested it. Filezilla is much better.
gftp~~~1321688825~~~borgio3~~~4~~~My only, and preferred ftp client

ghc6-doc~~~1278417740~~~Glowiej~~~5~~~Simply great.
ghemical~~~1283646456~~~N3MKH~~~4~~~Much potential here! Easier to use than some of the standard computatioal chemistry systems I have tried over the years. I am impressed with the potential! Documentation is OK for one experienced with such programs, but the project could use a newbie doc for those encountering computational chemistry via this project.

ghex~~~1315039931~~~Chrunchstick~~~5~~~It's great!
ghex~~~1318296309~~~registereduser~~~1~~~absolutely useless. sure it can Hex edit files, but not hard drive sectors. Real hex editors can edit a hard drive. So far Linux has no real hex editors

gimp~~~1267696546~~~Pierre~~~4~~~Lets you edit images
gimp~~~1267697443~~~ddalley~~~3~~~Archaic interface, not intuitive and cumbersome, but full-featured. Most people need a lighter weight, more intuitive image editor, but good ones are difficult to find.
gimp~~~1267701806~~~clem~~~5~~~Long learning curve, but it's well worth it. Really handy tool.
gimp~~~1271305697~~~KittyKatt~~~5~~~I've been using GIMP for the past 3 years now, and I'll take it over PS any day of the week. Maybe that's just because I'm used to it or maybe it's because I can't shell out the money for a graphics program no better than GIMP. ;)
gimp~~~1286040291~~~Teucca~~~5~~~Great graphics, edit my screen shots with this
gimp~~~1271356896~~~captainhaggy~~~5~~~Wer noch ##toshop nutzt, ist selber schuld. GIMP ist wohl der Standard, wenn es um Bildbearbeitung geht. Kostenfrei und exzellent. Aber niemand hat behauptet, man müßte sich nicht einarbeiten. Ein kostenloses Handbuch ist in den Paketquellen vorhanden.
gimp~~~1295801273~~~kunk~~~5~~~Great editor.
gimp~~~1273115522~~~jatwood~~~5~~~I have just started using GIMP for making some LinuxMint wallpaper of my own and I really have liked it.  I am still getting used to the interface, but it's growing on me.
gimp~~~1273153218~~~nilsgeylen~~~5~~~Getting better and better and it doesn't randomly crash as Photoshop does
gimp~~~1273207863~~~VICTOR360~~~5~~~Simple,Easy,And Fast Great Alternative 2 Adobe cs5!
gimp~~~1273544107~~~linuxmint~~~5~~~Awesome program to edit graphics. I hope it's kept in future releases of linux mint! It is a good alternative for Photoshop
gimp~~~1273755669~~~Rich_Roast~~~5~~~Features constantly improving
gimp~~~1273957573~~~jkw~~~5~~~I don't do much graphics, but when I'm going to edit any photo to remove red eyes, do some minor logo or something Gimp is wonderful. It can even be used for more powerful graphics, but that's out of my league.
gimp~~~1274017594~~~huntman~~~5~~~best grapichs program
gimp~~~1294681647~~~pbmuk~~~4~~~Very powerful. Does everything. The interface takes some getting used to

gimp~~~1274349705~~~Felagund~~~4~~~Aussi utile pour des retouches de base que pour des manipulations complexes : un tout-en-un parfait si on se laisse le temps de la découverte.
gimp~~~1274374999~~~anchorschmidt~~~5~~~Amazing!
gimp~~~1274405154~~~nixnine~~~5~~~Gimp is as powerful an image editing program as any.  I would recommend it to anyone who considers spending $$$ on other "Professional" software.  Gimp IS a Pro.
gimp~~~1274520282~~~salli~~~5~~~there is no better
gimp~~~1274601835~~~begrebela~~~5~~~I use it every day and I love it!
gimp~~~1274811816~~~ghilly63~~~4~~~Takes a bit of patience
gimp~~~1274818597~~~helgen~~~5~~~Best image editor around, second only to photoshop, but this ones free. If you miss any functions, install more plugins and brushes, you can use photoshop brushes too. The only thing that could be done better is the interface that is better in photoshop, so i therefore say its second to it and not number 1.
gimp~~~1274874505~~~Ambient~~~4~~~Best image editor on Linux, its a bit advanced on some points (for the average user). But then, who said doing advanced effects/changes to images wouldnt be advanced?
gimp~~~1274917807~~~Canid~~~5~~~Muito bom!!!
gimp~~~1282005060~~~thx1138~~~5~~~Das Photoshop-Äquivalent unter Linux. Unzählige Plugins lassen das Progg dem teuren Windows-Bruder in Nichts nachstehen.
gimp~~~1275074378~~~Bob63~~~4~~~Very nice. Moderate learning curve. Many tutorials available on 'net.
gimp~~~1275128017~~~rappelkiste_src~~~5~~~Die Referenz unter Linux. Wenn auch nicht einfach zu lernen. Weitreichende Unterstützung im Netz.
gimp~~~1275277502~~~mariovfernandez~~~5~~~An awesome photo editor. Excellent alternative to Photoshop.
gimp~~~1275309662~~~RandyNose~~~5~~~Yet another example of how open source works. Geat program, a little funky to use if you're used to Photoshop, Paintshop, etc...  Once you get  used to the three windows/screens it's actually a little easier to use. :)
gimp~~~1275391650~~~dorylinux~~~5~~~ho buttato photoshop nel 2007 e da allora uso solo GIMP!!! ;-)
gimp~~~1275526080~~~SeanBest~~~5~~~Takes awhile to get used to, but best imaging software in Linux.
gimp~~~1275709217~~~caleb06866~~~5~~~5 star software (and it's way Better than Photoshop))
gimp~~~1275798436~~~Pariah~~~5~~~Hardest app in the known universe but well worth the effort!! can't wait for 2.8
gimp~~~1275871603~~~aibo~~~4~~~a bit of a learning curve, but the more you learn, the more useful gimp becomes
gimp~~~1276523843~~~pikkuteemu~~~5~~~It's getting harder and harder to remember how things were done in PS ..
gimp~~~1276529115~~~oscar799~~~5~~~I've been using GIMP for a year now.....wouldn't want PS even if it was being given away free...
gimp~~~1276535459~~~Craig_Dem~~~5~~~Fantastic image editor, I find it easier to use than Photoshop.
gimp~~~1276563906~~~mikefreeman~~~5~~~Excellent graphics program! If it doesn't have what you need, it's probably just a plugin away.

gimp~~~1282106085~~~flor_de_azucena~~~5~~~They say it's not a professional tool. Well, I don't need one. What I need is tampering with my photos:) and that's what GIMP does perfectly.
gimp~~~1282227896~~~umka~~~5~~~The best!!!
gimp~~~1311876959~~~sigurd1701~~~5~~~The Standard. even compared with very expensive Professional Progs. A bit more convenience for newbies would be fine.

gimp~~~1284468038~~~linux1492~~~5~~~Some people reject GIMP! I HAVE ABSOLUTE NO IDEA WHY!!! GIMP is one of the very best image processing programs. Now consider that this software is open source and you can do most of the stuff you wish to do with an image processing program. If you need more than GIMP can offer you must be professional and need to invest lots of money for little more. For the rest of all users GIMP is the best you can install on your machine.

gimp~~~1290404883~~~killmess~~~4~~~It's nice and powerful, but his User Interface can be better, unified windows, and less unused space between icons and labels would be great.
gimp~~~1290742411~~~Doruletz~~~4~~~Save $300 to $500 vs. Adobe Photoshop. Does everything and more. Truly awesome, still a bit complicated - could've been more simple and user friendly... Takes a long while to feel comfortable with Gimp. Also the user guide (manual) is basic, not much to learn from it.
gimp~~~1291113059~~~zaenal1234~~~5~~~great.!!! to edit images / photos, etc. & compatible with many file formats.

gimp~~~1295328233~~~ChirmiPlay~~~5~~~Es un muy buen programa con un futuro asegurado si se sigue actualizando.
gimp~~~1295354140~~~simmy~~~4~~~I like gimp, but as a photo shop user, the few complaints i have are apparent when using gimp. Mainly for me the lack of a singular window, bt a modular window program, is a bit confusing for me, and why cant Iwarp have a full screen preview? lots of small bothers for me..but if you bother to learn its way of doing things, and its limitations, it does its job, just dont expect Photoshop.
gimp~~~1295661419~~~Ehecatl1138~~~4~~~Muy bueno y en camino de convertirse en una auténtica alternativa seria a Photoshop.
gimp~~~1295720945~~~fcole90~~~5~~~I work with that!
gimp~~~1295925401~~~houn~~~5~~~just need to get used to the Ui and keyboard shortcuts...
gimp~~~1296739333~~~strugk~~~5~~~very good aplication
gimp~~~1297056527~~~flan_suse~~~3~~~It's good enough for small things, but definitely not a Photoshop killer. It took them 15 years to finally introduce a single-window mode... but they don't even set it as default?! 15 years! What are the GIMP developers thinking? They need to hire a real UI designer!
gimp~~~1297216070~~~cmaew04~~~4~~~Fantastic. Does everything you need for advanced or simple editing. The only drawback is that it is difficult to learn to use.
gimp~~~1297593238~~~mudslinger~~~5~~~it's been a good upgrade from the old legacy image editors I had on windows
gimp~~~1297627472~~~daedra333~~~5~~~Great program but please upgrade the repos to 2.72!

gimp~~~1298805197~~~Inoki~~~5~~~At first seems a bit clumsy, but after you start to work with this tool you'll eventually find yourself hooked to it. Better than Photoshop if you ask me. Why? A number of reasons. First of, it's free, it's light and very extensible unlike Photoshop, which is too dang expensive and everything for it is expensive too. GIMP has 100% .psd compatibility and dispones with features PS will never have. People know what people need and they make it that way. Congrats for making the best raster program ever!

gimp~~~1305663052~~~CDEX~~~1~~~It needs more to be useful. Make a simple watermark could be more easy. And sorry, Photoshop do it better than GIMP. We can't integrate to our systems, we prefer Photoshop (all we need is a funcional soft, not a problem to find features) Maybe somebody can share a better replacement, thanks in advance.

gimp~~~1311371051~~~Tomas_IV~~~5~~~Excelent photo retouching tool. Many have problems to accustom themselves to the interface after using Photoshop, but I have ever used GIMP, so it is the Photoshop which seems to me so unintuitive and unusual...
gimp~~~1311448795~~~stanlee~~~5~~~My favorit!!!
gimp~~~1311491503~~~bugz~~~5~~~GIMP requires almost no learning to perform common operations with graphics. I'm happy that it is included in default distribution.

gimp~~~1312294219~~~mintlinux~~~5~~~Just plain amazing. Photo editing, making touch-ups, whatever you photo needs are. You shold also look at the plugins, they contain things such as brushes, patterns, etc. 5*

gimp~~~1315103105~~~rpstitz~~~4~~~cool seeing the results, but learning how to use all of the features would just about require college courses.

gimp~~~1315385252~~~akaawol~~~5~~~AWESOME!
gimp~~~1315409080~~~henriquemaia~~~4~~~An absolute must for anyone editing pictures. The lacking star is for the missing single-window mode. When 2.8 comes out with this feature, I'll the add that star.
gimp~~~1315699488~~~PranavAart~~~4~~~Requires a little time to work well with, But its awesome.
gimp~~~1315772337~~~WalksIn2Trees~~~4~~~lacks a number of features, but there are many plug-ins to fill most of the gaps... even with the highest rated effects plugins though, there's still no equvalent to Median, and it cannot open 32-bit sRGB images... a must-have for pros

git-cola~~~1279083880~~~opticyclic~~~3~~~SmartGit is a much better option if you want a GUI for Git (http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/index.html). Git-cola has useful functions, its just that they are presented in an even nicer GUI with SmartGit.
git-core~~~1279598449~~~Idumea~~~5~~~Really helpful version control system.
git-core~~~1279212552~~~clem~~~5~~~Brilliant! Love it!
git-core~~~1281474242~~~AcolyteVersion1~~~5~~~Incredibly powerful and flexible version control system.  A little complex for new users, but more than worth the learning curve given the power of the program.

git-core~~~1306688658~~~marcelofmatos~~~5~~~Robust and fast!

git-core~~~1309552960~~~CaptSaltyJack~~~5~~~Uhh, better than SVN? absolutely!
git-core~~~1320151162~~~zcode~~~4~~~I like all the core concepts, but think the staging process needs to be improved. It is sometimes unclear what included and not. Generally superb.
git-core~~~1320921810~~~nebjak~~~5~~~The best distributed revision control system. I use it everyday. Super fast!
git-svn~~~1279081377~~~opticyclic~~~4~~~Essential for migrating from SVN to Git!

giver~~~1311877742~~~sigurd1701~~~5~~~almost perfect. should have a different (choosable) destination than the desktop!
giver~~~1312333604~~~blueXrider~~~3~~~didnt like it
giver~~~1312616403~~~Squirrel~~~4~~~It's quick and easy, but you cannot send folders. Also, it does not give you any feedback if you drag something to it that it cannot send.

gl-117~~~1305929645~~~JarlArntzen~~~2~~~Very rudimentary flight sim. Probably quite fun for children. Screen goes black when I start it and I have to Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get a proper image.
glabels~~~1274128599~~~wburke20~~~4~~~I give this little program 4 stars out of 5.I don't think that there is anything like this for Linux.

glabels~~~1309177986~~~thorneo~~~4~~~This is a very good program to use. I've watched it progress from my days using Ubuntu 6.06 LTS all the way to U 10.04 LTS and really like the way it has progressed..

glchess~~~1286219286~~~Xyie~~~4~~~A classic 2D view AND a 3D view? Both with animation? Even though I never win at these, this looks like a really nice chess game.
glchess~~~1287067762~~~kronomia~~~4~~~A simple but yet decent chess engine.

glchess~~~1304527423~~~Cipi~~~4~~~Simple and hard game... 2 hard to win even @ easy playing...
glchess~~~1306229164~~~Calensito~~~5~~~Este y el dreamches me gustan mucho :)
glchess~~~1309126038~~~Redstring~~~5~~~As a beginner the lighted tiles for pieces in jeopardy really come in handy.  As well as the option to number the tiles.  Features I do not remember being on my Windows 7 chess game.   The only complains is I wish it had a 1-10 difficulty option instead of only Easy, Med, Hard  (Easy seems a little harder than it should be).  Also, the 3d mode has pretty basic graphic quality.  Not a big deal if you prefer 2d like I do.
glest~~~1271329143~~~woockash~~~2~~~Graphics ok, but there is no gameplay.
glest~~~1273613074~~~kneekoo~~~3~~~The game looks promising but it still needs work.
glest~~~1276012438~~~dragonapocalypse~~~5~~~I love Glest, but prefere it´s more modern version, MegaGlest. The graphics, etc.., however, do work, but you need to edit the glest.ini file first
glest~~~1293557654~~~noman2008~~~5~~~upgrade graphics quality
glest~~~1295000017~~~pancaran~~~4~~~good
glest~~~1296752876~~~akash211~~~4~~~Something like demo version of Age of Empire
glest~~~1298368411~~~hellangel~~~5~~~its nice but the mouse action really bad need work on that nothing more i love it !
glest~~~1298848261~~~Anubis~~~4~~~Awesome gameplay over lan,  i do think the AI opponents needs to be improved though.
glest~~~1303769630~~~gamezzy~~~5~~~Identical to age of empires!
glest~~~1307634079~~~darksidecorrales~~~1~~~No he conseguido que arranque en mi netbook con LinuxMint 11, cada vez que intento arrancarla se queda bloqueado.
glest~~~1315909373~~~linux1492~~~2~~~Certainly the game is working, but I find the handling not good solved. Also it seems that as a newbe one has to find instructions from elsewhere then the game. I find it too complex to start up with and have fun within minutes. Since I can not affort to play all day long this game is nothing for people who just want to play for just a moment and turn back to more urgent matters then gaming.
glines~~~1286219426~~~Xyie~~~5~~~This simple game is simply too addictive!
glines~~~1310139741~~~neurone-mint~~~5~~~i'm addicted
glipper~~~1275985952~~~pbmuk~~~3~~~It keeps a clipboard history but when you select a clip it doesn't paste it immediately, it just moves it to the active clipboard so you still have to ctrl-V to paste. There are reports that it interferes with copying and pasting images.

gmail-notify~~~1295558353~~~Elisa~~~2~~~No big deal...
gmail-notify~~~1315881610~~~opm595~~~4~~~In my opinion, thumbs-up to the Devs on this one. Works flawlessly for me, without a problem, and incredibly easy to configure too. Well done!
gmail-notify~~~1316215862~~~newrave~~~5~~~Unter Ubuntu finde ich "gm-notify" praktischer, weil es sich besser in die Ubuntu Oberfläche einfügt. Unter Linux Mint ist "gmail-notify" einen Tick besser, da es sich im Gnome-Panel einnistet und leicht zu bedienen ist.
gmail-notify~~~1320512336~~~streamnl~~~3~~~it's shows when you got a new email (almost at the same time, so that a good thing). But when I click on the new email, nothing happens. I also can't go to my inbox with the widget.
gmameui~~~1295435605~~~enscott1030~~~2~~~Not impressed. Either half my roms don't work or I lose sound and have to manually flip the screen for every other game, depending on what flavor of MAME i use. Plus Xbox360 controls are loose and not easily configurable. Here's what I recommend for us Linux Mint/Ubuntu noobs: MAME/SDLMAME and xboxdrv from these software repos + QMC2 (MAME frontend for Gnome found at http://qmc2.arcadehits.net/wordpress/). Much more rom playability plus you can remap your Xbox360 controller and make it as tight as you like.
gmameui~~~1316470225~~~Luthenis~~~1~~~Doesn't work properly
gmchess~~~1274610519~~~patriki~~~4~~~Very good, should be nice to choose level.

gmusicbrowser~~~1273943926~~~Alexio~~~5~~~This is the best music library browser/manager I could find!
gmusicbrowser~~~1291613093~~~Oscar~~~5~~~Very good music player with nice faetures, easy for to use and with a great lookin interface ( I think the best of the linux players) and that because have a lot of layouts for to choose and take advantage of album art and artist pics for to get the closer you can get in linux to a foobar2000 player feel  especially if you customize with some colors of your likeness to your desktop's windows.
gmusicbrowser~~~1279157729~~~sigixv~~~4~~~Less confusing than Amarok/Exaile, more powerfull than Rhythmbox and doesnt crash (like Banshee does unfortunatly)
gmusicbrowser~~~1280235722~~~ivanovnegro~~~2~~~Too slow and spends too much ressources on my machine.
gmusicbrowser~~~1286677757~~~zaenal1234~~~5~~~i like this, for my music.
gmusicbrowser~~~1291060206~~~Da_Londo~~~4~~~Better than the rest
gmusicbrowser~~~1293011802~~~gericom~~~5~~~The best player EVER! It must be default on any distro! :)))
gmusicbrowser~~~1293316581~~~romanybob~~~5~~~Runs like a dream, simple, no bugs or crashes as yet. Had problems with most other players I have tried (Amarok/Rythmbox/Banshee.)
gmusicbrowser~~~1294355679~~~hexram~~~5~~~Step aside, competition! No chance for anyone else
gmusicbrowser~~~1295354060~~~DIONISIS_POLITIS~~~4~~~by far the best, but it lacks ipod syncronization.
gmusicbrowser~~~1300194826~~~k273~~~2~~~More confusing than any other music player GUI out there. An overkill/bloatware. For cd rip, use Sound-Juicer. For batch tagging, use easyTAG. For anything else, there are more intuitive player out there. I use Banshee.
gmusicbrowser~~~1308504413~~~mitanshugamer~~~5~~~Simply loved it. too great. perhaps mint should replace it with banshee as default because it is easy on memory..
gmusicbrowser~~~1308506986~~~wanda~~~2~~~Remove Banshee ,install Totem - Audacious - VLC
gmusicbrowser~~~1308509684~~~SeventhReign~~~3~~~Too advanced for the average user.  Has a tendency to corrupt files when editing tags.  Uses quite a bit more memory than most media players.  Interface is ugly no matter which interface you choose.
gmusicbrowser~~~1308511921~~~LONNIEFUTURE~~~2~~~I have to admit i dont use any music browser. VLC sorta takes the place of everything like the old windows media player did.
gmusicbrowser~~~1309076100~~~trollboy~~~5~~~Doesn't have the playlist annoyances of Rhythmbox. Isn't mono encumbered like Banshee. Works better than Exaile.
gmusicbrowser~~~1312585430~~~CENTMINT~~~5~~~Give it a try, give it some time and you'll love all gmusicbrowser's features.
gmusicbrowser~~~1313799088~~~idiotmagoo~~~5~~~love the small memory footprint and has just enough bling
gmusicbrowser~~~1314621436~~~MajorGrubert~~~4~~~Léger, efficace, paramétrable à souhait, pas très loin de Foobar2000

gnash~~~1291662760~~~marksuci~~~5~~~Nezamjenjiv
gnash~~~1309691057~~~wanda~~~2~~~gnash bad ,Openjdk  very gut.
gnash~~~1299242463~~~Kupfer~~~5~~~Can be really helpful if adobe flash is by a bug. Sure it's nowhere near a replacement for it, but actually quite satisfying. Pair it with Minitube for a fuller experience.
gnash~~~1309689717~~~obakfahad~~~5~~~Need it for your swf viewing.
gnash~~~1311729776~~~charliefordjr~~~3~~~A lot of flash works with this, also I'm on PPC so it's all I can ask for.
gnat-4.4~~~1321967875~~~asedt~~~5~~~Best Ada compiler, Install this if you whant to use gnatmake in terminal, also this is the GCC-GNAT wich has different licence compered to GNAT-GPL from AdaCore.
gnat-gps~~~1315427629~~~hans~~~5~~~It just works!
gnect~~~1288725751~~~Xyie~~~4~~~This game has a tricky-to-beat AI. Plays just like "Connect Four" with several themes. Not always the prettiest look, but it plays quite well.

gnome-breakout~~~1292179648~~~Trinexx~~~1~~~Terrible clone. Graphics are hideous, the gameplay itself feels terrible. I wouldn't inflict this game on my enemies.
gnome-breakout~~~1319573421~~~AlmightyDoerOfStuff~~~4~~~It's old and half-finished. Slightly glitchy, with no sound or documentation, but by looking at the preferences and the filenames in /usr/share/games/gnome-breakout/pixmaps, and just by playing, it's easy to figure out. What IS there? Four nice and simple, configurable controls (left, right, fire left, fire right) for mouse or keyboard, plus configurable play speed. High score chart. Nice, clean graphics, plus a cute splash screen. Three level sets, three difficulty settings. Nice pause/autopause features, and a Kill Ball feature if necessary. Seven powerups, no annoying powerdowns. Altogether I give it 4 stars for being fun and simple, just the way Breakout should be. I'd give it 5 stars if it had sound and documentation.

gnome-do~~~1311524235~~~bugz~~~5~~~Overwhelming application. And the functionality can be expanded with non-official plugins. Think what you want and start expressing that. Gnome-do will try to guess your intention as soon as it possible. Must have.
gnome-do~~~1313395644~~~gabrielsays~~~4~~~Spectacular! If you use openbox (such as in peppermint OS) you will have install libfile-mimeinfo-perl so Gnome Do will open folders in the file manager instead of the web browser.

You have to know the very basics of partitioning in Linux if you want to do it manually, but if you let Gparted do it for you, you'll be done in no time. (if you are installing Linux Mint for example ) This is a high quality partitioner, I'm  sorprised  it is  open source.

I have downloaded andinstall 4 times and each time it goesinto an endless search for /dev/sda partions andnever finds any.  ,It is useless as far as I am concerned.  If I was able to give it a negative number  I would rateit minus 5.

gparted~~~1315705989~~~kennethb~~~5~~~Wonderful! And to give a reply to bern3485, this case is probably caused by a bad partition table. Maybe you need some more advanced softwares, or more straight forwardly, you can create a new partition table and lose all data.

gparted~~~1322046463~~~Simeon~~~5~~~Say, what a tool.
gpdftext~~~1320350688~~~shusse~~~3~~~A little too basic. Titles and headings lose formatting and get smashed together into a wall of plain text, making it less than readable.
gpdftext~~~1316082841~~~kip-~~~5~~~great tool to extract text from pdf docs - im using for my kindle to get pictures away from books also it make them smaller as txt files so more books in kindle ;)
gpe-calendar~~~1289163995~~~HeinrichHirsch~~~4~~~einfach aber klar - gut
gpe-julia~~~1284481555~~~muninnhuginn~~~4~~~Does what it says on the box! pretty, but I can't see me keeping it around for long.
gpe-othello~~~1307250937~~~flamemaster~~~3~~~not much better than grhino... I beat it several times...( 8 out of 10 )

gphoto2~~~1281205524~~~secmff~~~5~~~I love CLI for all jobs
gphpedit~~~1310515732~~~dscapuano~~~2~~~I don't see why anyone needs this.  Perhaps I missed something
gphpedit~~~1315672749~~~blonder413~~~1~~~más que un ide php es un editor de texto común
gphpedit~~~1315940243~~~zeachco~~~3~~~nice class and functions browsing but cannot edit .js files, cannot as well open the folder browser in same time as the function/class browser, handle large project and remain light to start and to operate, cannot customize colors to a darker theme as not all text elements are customisable (look awfull), reload last files on startup (wich I like)
gpicview~~~1274612708~~~vanyok~~~5~~~lightweight and easy to use
gpicview~~~1289044486~~~Inoki~~~5~~~The best :) suits all your needs, if you want something simple, very usable and intuitive :) you got everything where you can see it and it's super light :) this should be included as a default app for mint :)
gpicview~~~1299470328~~~derschreckliche~~~4~~~Nice lightweight viewer, but i like Viewnior better.
gpicview~~~1302288906~~~k273~~~4~~~It's the simplest one out there. Reminiscent of Windows Picture Viewer (from XP to 7).
gpicview~~~1302551130~~~pazoff~~~5~~~Very, very fast!
gpicview~~~1303936769~~~jose76c~~~5~~~Fast, easy to use, has everything I need: fullscreen with doubleclick, browse with mousewheel, rotate pics. Can be set as a default viewer in preferences.
gpicview~~~1305281056~~~farnaby~~~3~~~may be fast - but essential feature missing: printing.
gpicview~~~1311441922~~~Germmare~~~2~~~gwenview is now my favorit

gpodder~~~1287668649~~~nipapoo~~~5~~~this is the first podcast program that is nearly perfect for me!
gpodder~~~1288503469~~~overdriven~~~5~~~Looks amazing and everything is simple, best podcast manager.
gpodder~~~1290807920~~~Deadite81~~~4~~~It's good, but misses some core options that I can't live without.
gpodder~~~1291428531~~~d00med~~~5~~~Light and functional. Supports streaming, which is rare with these aggregators, but you must choose an audio player in the preferences to enable it
gpodder~~~1292393676~~~DJPhil~~~5~~~Simple, easily configured podcast aggregator. Definitely fits into the 'just works' category.
gpodder~~~1293717214~~~Yamba~~~5~~~Best podcast program out there, being it on linux, N900 or even windows
gpodder~~~1295876852~~~yahtzeek9~~~4~~~Best podcatcher I've found.
gpodder~~~1296539898~~~flan_suse~~~5~~~A light, sleek, no-nonsense podcatcher that does one thing, and one thing well!
gpodder~~~1300966820~~~jay4rest~~~5~~~By far the best podcatcher out there!
gpodder~~~1301339003~~~joeplugg~~~5~~~Have used it from my Nokia N800 and now in Mint. Improved and the best catcher for podcasts.

gpodder~~~1320166165~~~sebibob~~~5~~~1A. Habs täglich im Gebrauch. Könnt gar nicht mehr ohne.
gpointing-device-settings~~~1283315010~~~selekta77~~~3~~~Works on my Lenovo R61i but doesnt work correct on my Lenovo SL510
gpointing-device-settings~~~1283719932~~~textett~~~2~~~doesn't support 2 finger scrolling on my SAMSUNG N220 plus
gpointing-device-settings~~~1285530621~~~Ekcentric~~~4~~~Works perfectly with my Thinkpad T60
gpointing-device-settings~~~1285917475~~~baitisj~~~5~~~Far better than gsynaptics. This package allows a number of touchpad customization options that were dearly missed from my Windows installation
gpointing-device-settings~~~1316484083~~~japike~~~4~~~Works great for scroll wheel emulation on a logitech trackball
gpointing-device-settings~~~1300852924~~~miana~~~1~~~it doesn't show up after installation and my NEC laptop's touchpad is still not working. I don't know what else to do.
gpointing-device-settings~~~1299771163~~~fido1357~~~5~~~Perfect for activation control point scroll button on older thinkpads
gpointing-device-settings~~~1303291274~~~braxmint~~~5~~~Works great! For those with problems: you need to find the executable and launch it manually. To get the location, from terminal: "which gpointing-device-settings" and then navigate to the dir for your file.
gpredict~~~1282641118~~~linux1492~~~5~~~It is a great tool if you wish to monitor satellite tracks and forcaste or post process satellite conjunctions
gpredict~~~1289820860~~~allensnowdon~~~1~~~Won't save or print predictions; ground track has to be manually started; latest release not available in DEB package
gpredict~~~1296800863~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Fun! I enjoy astronomy and satelite watching, so this is great!
gpredict~~~1306587192~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~5~~~Wonderful and simple app to track the position of satellites and the space station
gprename~~~1274686176~~~patriki~~~5~~~Great utility!
gprename~~~1277284153~~~tombom3000~~~4~~~Really useful, easy to use, allows you to batch rename lots of files relatively quickly.
gprename~~~1283120471~~~jajodo~~~5~~~Great.  Quick and many options.
gprename~~~1283283704~~~Zinnaca~~~1~~~really stupid ui that does not really help with renaming files!
gprename~~~1288607105~~~punkrtekk~~~1~~~Slow, buggy, user-unfriendly, not many options... far far behind Krename!
gprename~~~1289913597~~~motocamp~~~5~~~I use it over 3 years - works great and has a lot of good features
gprename~~~1290806644~~~Deadite81~~~3~~~Not bad, but Pyrenamer is a much more comprehensive mass renamer.
gprename~~~1292620849~~~gioblack92~~~5~~~Eccellente, pieno controllo sui nomi dei file, pieno di funzioni!
gprename~~~1295984241~~~efthialex~~~4~~~Very nice
gprename~~~1297703463~~~orion8~~~2~~~I found gprename hard to use.  pyrenamer did what I wanted and had better help.
gprename~~~1302384424~~~Germmare~~~4~~~used it sometimes...
gprename~~~1304445116~~~Rafson~~~4~~~it could have more options and features, however for me it works very vell :)
gprename~~~1307803516~~~birkopf~~~5~~~I love this program. It's so user friendly, simple and effective. All in it's place. 5Stars!
gprename~~~1309022167~~~dodies~~~3~~~Sono passato da Krename a GPrename per via delle dipendeze. Ma le opzioni e il modo di operare non è allo stesso livello. Meno intuitivo e meno versatile del collega con la k.
gprename~~~1319791046~~~cirx~~~4~~~Not a beauty but does the job; meets my needs a bit better than pyrenamer.

grafx2~~~1296077856~~~Boringbytes~~~2~~~Not for everyone, such a basic pixel editor should be much easier to learn and use.
grafx2~~~1298138492~~~xcausex~~~5~~~This package rocks for creating old school palletized graphics, perfect for those interested in modding old game tiles or creating their own retro games. This package is surprisingly feature filled; layers, split screen view for zooming in on parts of your image for fine tune edits and you can even extend the software's functionality using lua scripts.
gramps~~~1277196958~~~kage~~~4~~~Works like it should. "its looks" could bebetter
gramps~~~1279067813~~~dumpstar123~~~5~~~Love it! This program is a BEAST!!

gramps~~~1294538891~~~Speedyweb~~~5~~~Tolles Programm zur Ahnenforschung, und da es GEDCOM Dateien lesen und schreiben kann, kann man die Daten mit anderen Programmen austauschen
gramps~~~1302696222~~~Belarus_IRus~~~5~~~very useful.
gramps~~~1311378507~~~RevDieter~~~5~~~Wonderful piece of software! It is - via GEDCOM - compatible with many expensive programs which run exclusively on Redmond OSs. I'd like to see some eyecandy-overhaul in the on-screen and printed presentation of the data - but that's just a matter of taste...
granatier~~~1292082455~~~titoui~~~4~~~Excellent, comme le vrai bomberman, mais beaucoup de plantage... dommage

grass~~~1318141114~~~marsofearth~~~5~~~Fantastic GIS - Even greater when used with QGIS as the front end.
grass~~~1321800074~~~antolieztsu~~~5~~~The best GIS ever
grdesktop~~~1280601150~~~selekta77~~~5~~~Absolut Perfekt!
grdesktop~~~1290107873~~~Txnca~~~3~~~Having used a couple of these program I can honestly say that this one works.  It will connect to your system and it will save your configuration for you.  Don't expect anything else though.  If is not fancy, it will not allow you to resize the windows or minimize it so you can see your desktop.  If anyone can suggest a better one for Gnome I would go to it.  Until then I am stuck with this one.  KRDC for KDE is MUCH better than this one is.
grdesktop~~~1300890039~~~kip-~~~5~~~works as charm :)

grpn~~~1322061658~~~chassum~~~4~~~quick and easy rpn gui.
grsync~~~1271390577~~~saquerocl~~~4~~~Realmente buen programa, facilita enormemente la tarea de realizar respaldos. Usandolo con un disco duro externo garantiza que todo irá perfecto.
grsync~~~1273935753~~~RandyNose~~~4~~~This is a great little program, it could use some tweaking to get it more GUI user friendly,  to create lists, etc. Works faster then to drag and drop files.
grsync~~~1277325882~~~pbmuk~~~5~~~Fantastic little program. I use this for backups as my documents aren't in my home folder.
grsync~~~1274153354~~~jajodo~~~5~~~Use it all the time.  Plays well with the freenas rsync server and a great backup program with the addition of a simple script
grsync~~~1289675063~~~pirategeorges~~~4~~~use often for backup
grsync~~~1276575630~~~selekta77~~~4~~~Good! But i need a list of folders that i can sync
grsync~~~1276927059~~~thebrix~~~4~~~Makes synchronising an external drive with my laptop simple
grsync~~~1277037954~~~neurone~~~4~~~ottimo programma di sincronizzazione, unico difetto: non è intuitivo capire il report
grsync~~~1313659118~~~nilhh~~~5~~~One of the
grsync~~~1288502441~~~mfy1992~~~4~~~nice
grsync~~~1289240308~~~defcon~~~5~~~sehr gut für backups
grsync~~~1294137217~~~telewatho~~~4~~~An excellent choice for making rsync more user-friendly. Also shows you the rsync command before it is executed. Allows the user to add more CLI options that are not currently implemented in the GUI. Allows saving of sessions. Quite self-documenting. Best progress meter I have ever seen.  Needs a bit of tweaking
grsync~~~1294451237~~~grim~~~5~~~I use it to backup data, pretty useful and always does the job!
grsync~~~1294743834~~~gilshwartz~~~4~~~Very useful tool. Could use a few more checkboxes for rsync options.
grsync~~~1295034336~~~ludentico~~~4~~~Nice app to backup
grsync~~~1298167037~~~markovian~~~5~~~I use this program to sync files with my nas. I like that I don't have to zip them all into a single archive. Instead I can retrieve an individual file as needed.
grsync~~~1302415684~~~putnik~~~5~~~????? ?????????,??? ????????
grsync~~~1306923199~~~RytronII~~~5~~~I use this for all my syncing needs.

grsync~~~1310139627~~~neurone-mint~~~4~~~nice app
grsync~~~1311445426~~~Germmare~~~3~~~i give it a try ...
grsync~~~1315436177~~~toto_de_France~~~5~~~sauvegarde de son home, très bien.
grsync~~~1316686055~~~McVoiceX~~~5~~~Well.
grsync~~~1319459966~~~tinyCubensis~~~5~~~Awesome!
grsync~~~1321716768~~~dmutters~~~5~~~Simple to use, yet featureful.  Checkboxes for common/uncommon rsync options; text boxes for custom command-line tweaks.  Works great for local backup (different drives/directories on 1 computer), as well as remote backup.  Can delete extraneous files on the destination.  Does not create an unwieldy metadata directory; you can delete files directly from the destination if you so choose, without messing everything up (though I've rarely had reason to do this).  A few very minor eccentricities that have not been problematic for me.  Much better than pybackpack and others I've tried!

gscan2pdf~~~1276518776~~~OldMarcus~~~4~~~Reallly nice app here, gives easy access to various scanning tools, while making sure you have all the options should you need them Only fault I can see is that it sometimes hangs when saving the scan to a file, especially with high DPI. 4/5, good work. =]

gthumb~~~1282320534~~~strayharmony~~~5~~~Fast, intuitive, basic, free.
gthumb~~~1282578079~~~French~~~5~~~Good enough for me
gthumb~~~1284644744~~~AbeFreeman~~~5~~~I replaced fspot in favour of this program, since it's just as simple but allows cropping and resizing.
gthumb~~~1288102161~~~Deadite81~~~5~~~By far my favorite image manager.
gthumb~~~1290014870~~~grhmdvs~~~4~~~Good image manager. Takes a while to load folders containing large numbers of photos, no straighten feature, otherwise excellent.
gthumb~~~1290932116~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Good
gthumb~~~1291493440~~~hellangel~~~5~~~like it very much
gthumb~~~1292060655~~~dagon~~~5~~~My favourite picture manager. Good functions and layout.
gthumb~~~1293456051~~~dangger~~~2~~~Converting images causes them to expand significantly in size
gthumb~~~1293874610~~~riki~~~5~~~Great app
gthumb~~~1294935316~~~grim~~~4~~~Better than EOG I would say :D
gthumb~~~1295792522~~~vesputs~~~5~~~why isnt this default
gthumb~~~1296683147~~~gerard~~~4~~~very fast and user friendly
gthumb~~~1308385434~~~guv999~~~4~~~v good program, very quick and straight forward to use .   Layout is not a good as Shotwell
gthumb~~~1302294112~~~k273~~~4~~~Still can't find the slideshow presentation, though...
gthumb~~~1304566344~~~damaskala~~~5~~~???? ACD 2.3 ???????
gthumb~~~1304745154~~~prativasic~~~5~~~Its just what I was looking for. I really like the Edit Picture Panel and actually looking for it
gthumb~~~1305537578~~~lapson~~~4~~~????? ???? ?? ?????
gthumb~~~1306554376~~~bulmaro90~~~2~~~tiene una interfaz que no me gusta y no organiza las fotos por fecha
gthumb~~~1306838285~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~4~~~good image viewer
gthumb~~~1306869705~~~slw_~~~4~~~good enough.
gthumb~~~1308696768~~~jhpassarelli~~~1~~~I do not like this program! Shotwell is better! :-)
gthumb~~~1309030813~~~jonna~~~5~~~Mejores herramientas
gthumb~~~1309345797~~~Gothmog~~~5~~~Has a lot of useful features.
gthumb~~~1309346343~~~SeventhReign~~~5~~~It might not be as fast as Shotwell, but it more than makes up for it in ease of use and features.  Simply the best native gnome image organizer/browser.
gthumb~~~1311663668~~~yusufbolu~~~4~~~I think it is better than eog
gthumb~~~1312264609~~~chash27~~~4~~~Nice tool to view images!
gthumb~~~1312980773~~~MaTachi~~~5~~~Works very well and does what it's supposed to.
gthumb~~~1313139418~~~itair~~~4~~~More features than eog
gthumb~~~1313165922~~~Terryphi~~~4~~~Uncomplicated and does what I need
gthumb~~~1313847157~~~filosofem666~~~4~~~Pretty good for what it is supposed to do but the UI could use some improvements.
gthumb~~~1314252903~~~gabor99~~~4~~~By adding sharpening capabilities, it could be a confortable Linux replacement of IrfanView.
gthumb~~~1314256122~~~inimmo~~~5~~~Have tried shotwell, imgseek, picasa and digikam, which are too complicated and GIMP to do major editing. Recommend it to anyone.
gthumb~~~1314273185~~~trollboy~~~5~~~Tried many other image managers and always end back with gthumb. It works beautifully under XFCE also.
gthumb~~~1314621560~~~MajorGrubert~~~4~~~Simple, léger et efficace
gthumb~~~1315795655~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~Nice
gthumb~~~1316150143~~~roo79x~~~5~~~it's far more intuitive and has more features than eog
gthumb~~~1316200385~~~legion1978~~~5~~~lightweight and powerful
gthumb~~~1316685987~~~McVoiceX~~~5~~~The Pocket Knife for the Photo Collection
gthumb~~~1317221459~~~Hil002~~~2~~~Prefiero Shotwell como organizador de fotografias
gthumb~~~1317601044~~~nathanos~~~3~~~OK
gthumb~~~1320164294~~~sebibob~~~3~~~Minimalistisch, aber funktioniert. Wieso muß Digikam nur mit diesem ganzem Akonadi Sch... kommen?
gtick~~~1280518791~~~patriki~~~4~~~Awesome!
gtick~~~1285311796~~~Theodor~~~5~~~hat alles was man braucht, sehr genau
gtick~~~1304785118~~~Gyrotwister~~~5~~~I have to start it with the command aoss gtick to get the sound to work.
gtick~~~1317589564~~~watkiss~~~4~~~Works well, but I have to start it using: "aoss gtick" rather than the start menu button (you can update the start menu yourself through the preferences as long as you've installed also-oss first)
gtimelog~~~1299632148~~~hexram~~~4~~~Fast, easy, no GUI time tracking app
gtimelog~~~1321799887~~~antolieztsu~~~4~~~Simple and fast. This tool is excellent to track your time

gtk-gnutella~~~1277143767~~~grizzo~~~3~~~It works great but is less simply than LimeWire
gtk-gnutella~~~1279980900~~~Firewolf~~~4~~~Nice P2P tool
gtk-gnutella~~~1291264342~~~CaArRi91~~~4~~~Buen P2P
gtk-gnutella~~~1310577520~~~mintidiot~~~3~~~Once you start getting the 'ancient version' error, your gtk-gnutella is toast. downloading gtk-gnutella96.9 is easy, trying to unpack is not possible and frustrating experience. pretty useless till the next build rolls out in new mint [or whatever flavor] build is sent out. not really great with the command line, but i can get around a little. not enough to run install for gtk-gnutella 96.9 tho.

gtk-smooth-themes~~~1291836546~~~marksuci~~~3~~~Ok
gtk-theme-switch~~~1295634044~~~Boringbytes~~~2~~~Currently I can see no advantage to using this package, except that it does detect and identify some errors in theme files. For management of the desktop theme I found the desktop appearance manager a far better option. This little app did cause problems with my display.

gtkvncviewer~~~1290457187~~~naviathan~~~4~~~It works.  Has all the basic features needed for a vncviewer.
gtkvncviewer~~~1295185404~~~jamesmvp~~~2~~~I couldn't get it to work, wouldn't start in Mint so used SSVNC which has a little more functions but seems to be far more stable and compatible with Remote desktop
gtkvncviewer~~~1296410543~~~Meizel~~~2~~~It worked the first time then bugged out with an error with the gnome key ring
gtkvncviewer~~~1301313624~~~johanjohnsson~~~2~~~Really bad performance, even on local. Dont know if it can be that my server computer is using an ATI graphic card.
gtkvncviewer~~~1315431528~~~MarkX~~~4~~~Poor performance on LAN. It works for what I need though. Thank you for the software!
gtodo~~~1283299183~~~axoloteDeAccion~~~5~~~It actually works and is simple. With this comes unintrusion. I just invented a Word!
gtodo~~~1320588572~~~cirx~~~5~~~Glad to have it, among the first things I install
gtranslator~~~1296233747~~~amb1402~~~5~~~nice

gtypist~~~1296683071~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Very good for a command-line typing tutor. I used this a while over other GUI typing tutors before I found a graphical one I prefered a bit more.
guake~~~1271324333~~~captainhaggy~~~5~~~Ohne Guake wäre mein Linux Mint nichts wert. Ich hoffe, es findet den Weg in die Standardinstallation. So hat man mit F12 jederzeit ein Terminalfenster und ist handlungsfähig, selbst wenn man mal keine Maus oder ein Touchpad zur Hand hat. Tip: Rechts anklicken und automatisch mitstarten lassen.
guake~~~1273066226~~~moorewarner~~~5~~~My favorite Linux terminal. It drops down with a hotkey, it has a nice transparency, tabs. This is a part of my default installs as well.
guake~~~1309754581~~~opensas~~~5~~~can't live without
guake~~~1274244986~~~hustletrees~~~5~~~smooth, quick, and becomes indispensible after even a few hours of usage.
guake~~~1274244986~~~hustletrees~~~5~~~smooth, quick, and becomes indispensible after even a few hours of usage.
guake~~~1274250527~~~huntman~~~5~~~number 1
guake~~~1274448347~~~conf~~~5~~~no need for all the shells floating helplessly around your virtual desktops. guake is extremely convenient while looking good at the same time, simply a must have. KDE users look for yakuake (however i don't like its appearance)
guake~~~1274895455~~~afriza~~~5~~~I love it. It provides easy access to the terminal without clutter
guake~~~1275092897~~~mafarevx~~~5~~~gorgeous
guake~~~1275158527~~~sede~~~5~~~must have!
guake~~~1275162768~~~rappelkiste_src~~~5~~~Terminalfenster läuft im Hintergrund mit und kann per F12 aufgerufen und geschlossen werden. Durch Transparentmode bleiben Informationen im Hintergrund sichtbar.
guake~~~1275483926~~~bqdbr~~~5~~~Great app, must have.
guake~~~1276863034~~~ipott~~~5~~~best Terminal
guake~~~1276946695~~~detelinka~~~5~~~very practical
guake~~~1276947059~~~ponpat~~~5~~~best terminal I know
guake~~~1276965421~~~vipek~~~4~~~Good. But could slide from top (like I saw it in KDE); and when you go out from fullscreen, the terminal doesn't expand to the whole screen width.
guake~~~1277410914~~~Twiguard~~~5~~~Lots of settings. Like it very much. ^^
guake~~~1277414939~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~I like it but the version available for Isadora has a minor issue. If I try to rename a tab, it will completely lose its name.
guake~~~1278255941~~~ketanf~~~5~~~on my gnome or lxde installations this is the bomb.
guake~~~1282079828~~~Jac978~~~4~~~I liked it so much earlier because of it is elegant but since I have been using terminator it is no more my favorite terminal.
guake~~~1283275881~~~Wicho~~~5~~~Very quick, nice and practiical!
guake~~~1283954267~~~glo0m~~~5~~~Very practical!! I made it appear/hide by an top-left-edge mouse event (compiz) :)
guake~~~1284272221~~~thrillseeker~~~5~~~Love it! It's both practical, and cool-looking/fun to use. I set it to the...key that looks like this ' that I can longer type with... I got used to it from Oblivion, and it's easier to reach. I think this will encourange me to learn and use the command line more.
guake~~~1284485870~~~gesthal~~~5~~~really useful.
guake~~~1284495098~~~ozos~~~5~~~I love it, It's so useful
guake~~~1288448091~~~kreativeone~~~5~~~Extremely useful. Well done design with all the right options. Be sure to change the transparency on the Appearance tab, otherwise the default will be difficult to read depending on your screen background.
guake~~~1289235624~~~hellangel~~~5~~~like it!
guake~~~1289236814~~~tdockery97~~~2~~~I don't see a need.  Right-click on desktop and open Terminal.  Is that hard?
guake~~~1289650734~~~nebjak~~~5~~~The best!
guake~~~1289789786~~~hexram~~~5~~~Very nice feature set.
guake~~~1290904375~~~yagolf~~~5~~~never went back to the normal terminal after trying this
guake~~~1290103633~~~nipapoo~~~4~~~love it but it keeps bugging up with transparency issues :(
guake~~~1290407645~~~killmess~~~5~~~Imprescindible! Buenisimo si sos de usar la consola a cada rato ( con Control+T abris otra pestaña) ;)
guake~~~1292373151~~~Shostako~~~5~~~Don't need another terminal, useful and pretty.
guake~~~1294174532~~~9littlebees~~~5~~~Be sure to set it to load at startup and spend a little time tweaking its preferences - you won't be disappointed!
guake~~~1294838180~~~L0r3nz0~~~4~~~It's nice to have a terminal which is quickly to be opened
guake~~~1295246119~~~kitzune~~~5~~~una muy bonita terminal y te puede salvar de varias
guake~~~1305979778~~~farocker~~~5~~~Great stuff and essential (for me) !
guake~~~1295481057~~~kindjal~~~5~~~Impressive ! Very useful ! Great idea, i never thought of it
guake~~~1296521258~~~mr_yurka~~~5~~~Just love it! After tweaking it a bit, I realized that having a functional "terminal background" is what I missed all the time before!
guake~~~1297076308~~~quaie~~~5~~~I found it by mistake while browsing the best rated packages and I find it  - EXQUISIT! keeping the terminals stacked in one pop-out window is very useful (at least for me)
guake~~~1298198798~~~mactar~~~4~~~mactar très pratique
guake~~~1298403591~~~novecento~~~5~~~I love it. It's really useful.
guake~~~1300502808~~~irpapabear~~~5~~~i love this app
guake~~~1302875313~~~rodrigo_uruguay~~~5~~~is really the best option to use all desktop space.
guake~~~1314752905~~~danstinebaugh~~~5~~~Love how easy it is to get to a terminal window now, Great Stuff!
guake~~~1304350381~~~arturobandini~~~5~~~really like it
guake~~~1304783420~~~smroose73~~~5~~~This is a must have for the cronic-customizer.  Just hit f12 and a transparent terminal comes up so you can apt-get install to your hearts content.  Fully customizable to fit whatever style you have at the moment.  Should be a default.
guake~~~1305408219~~~Zenettii~~~5~~~Possibly the most useful tool in my GUI environment. Rebind the standard F12 key to the key next to '1' (not 2! the otherside)
guake~~~1306543497~~~wother~~~4~~~Love it. Especially as I am loving the terminal more and more.
guake~~~1306869913~~~slw_~~~4~~~Quite handy; discrete and pretty. I like it a lot.
guake~~~1307308956~~~client26~~~5~~~billiant app
guake~~~1307660268~~~zapa~~~5~~~can't live without it !
guake~~~1308074356~~~elamperti~~~5~~~Really useful!
guake~~~1308078336~~~zacklyke~~~5~~~As smroose73 said, if you're heavy on the apt-get install you must get it. I love it.
guake~~~1311265317~~~tsagas~~~5~~~Guake is great for us CLI junkies :-)
guake~~~1312991015~~~thewilson~~~5~~~Super Convenient, too transparent by default, Great!
guake~~~1318971066~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~like it
guake~~~1314818593~~~piedpipr~~~5~~~This program has ruined the way I look at terminals.  I refuse to use anything but this.
guake~~~1314821567~~~trollboy~~~3~~~I used to love this but having gnome terminal embedded in my desktop using Compiz is soooo much cooler
guake~~~1316028534~~~Rafson~~~4~~~hmm it's just drop down terminal ... byt still can't live without it :)
guake~~~1317069314~~~bblonski~~~5~~~Really convenient if you use the CLI a lot.  Decent customization options, but could be better.
guake~~~1318704069~~~phucluoi~~~4~~~A must have for linux power user
guake~~~1319812358~~~cirx~~~5~~~Very handy! Unobtrusive. Appearance is highly configurable to fit an elegantl desktop, too.
guake~~~1320780707~~~chassum~~~4~~~Especially useful when you need a quick terminal while reading something in your browser.
guake~~~1320921236~~~mckie~~~4~~~Can't stay without it. But I think it needs the unlimited scrolling option.
guake~~~1321564848~~~nicord~~~5~~~love it!
guake~~~1321802119~~~iGRed~~~5~~~Really handy!
guake~~~1322059440~~~ringe~~~4~~~I'm addicted to this. The constant availability and out-of-focus features are very handy when multitasking.
guarddog~~~1320359404~~~luxy~~~2~~~It iis easy to setup. But it isn't cooperating with Ktorrent and others.
guarddog~~~1290332439~~~Elisa~~~5~~~I like it althoug due I'm still a newbie :) I still cannot set some specific rules which I'd like :) BTW a fine tutorial is here: http://newbiedoc.berlios.de/wiki/ Setting_up_a_personal_firewall_on_Debian_using_Guarddog - and - http://www.simonzone.com/software/ guarddog/manual2
guarddog~~~1293726241~~~jolouis32~~~5~~~top
guarddog~~~1294928130~~~miana~~~2~~~it prevents me from installing my touchpad. I don't know how the easiest way to be superuser whatever, so I guess it's not user friendly like zonealarm in windows. Had to remove it. Muah...
gucharmap~~~1288727187~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Not the simpliest character map to navigate, but it has a search feature that helps, and boy is it ever full of selections!
gufw~~~1270988998~~~Roin~~~5~~~Very nice GUI for UFW, It makes it possible for really everybody to activate and setup a firewall :).
gufw~~~1271328886~~~captainhaggy~~~3~~~Eine grafische Bedienung für die hauseigene Firewall. Leider ersetzt dieses Tool nicht den Sachverstand, den man beim Aufsetzen einer Firewall benötigt, von daher wäre es durchaus ratsamer, das Kommandozeilenprogramm ufw zu benutzen, es ist in meinen Augen verständlicher und schneller. Viel schneller.
gufw~~~1271587266~~~distrohopper~~~5~~~Makes setting up a firewall a breeze. It's not full of over-technical jargon.
gufw~~~1271812643~~~maty1206~~~4~~~Finally, a real GUI for iptables. Very easy to use, light and intuitive.  Recommended for newbies.
gufw~~~1276349766~~~Rich_Roast~~~4~~~Perfect for a quick and effective firewall
gufw~~~1286034865~~~ceptor~~~5~~~leicht zubedienendes graphisches frontend fuer iptables. damit laesst sich in kuerze ein ordentlicher schutz fuer den desktop-pc oder das notebook gestalten.

gufw~~~1319233897~~~new2nix~~~4~~~good firewall. does not cover scope rules worth a pooh, but is easy for begginers and quick for vets. People who do not use a firewall are just ASKing to be taken over. Very literally.
gummi~~~1306722478~~~sinapsis~~~5~~~My favorite LaTex editor: it's simple and has a real time viewer.
gummi~~~1317575275~~~carlosjimy~~~3~~~Va bien, es útil para algunos trabajos de edición, sobre todo con su vista en tiempo real del documento en PDF
gunroar~~~1281254206~~~Mito~~~5~~~Very good game! Nice graphics!
gunroar~~~1281815478~~~linux1492~~~1~~~Keeps you a minute or two asking what is coming next and then you wish you'd taken another game to entertain yourself. I would not recommendate it to download. But then again if you are a fan of pressing a fire button and do mechanical movements it might be fun.

gweled~~~1295033728~~~abrius~~~5~~~Simple, perfect game. Good job.
gweled~~~1296711798~~~Boringbytes~~~3~~~the jewel images are nice, and the game is ok. The game could be improved with the addtions of sound effects,  recognizable levels, and a nice player reward/incentive, like an interesting animation that plays on successful level completion.

gweled~~~1322204173~~~magicbus~~~5~~~Great. Found it a lot easier than wining Bejewled 3, but it's lacking in features in comparison (more like the first Bejewled). I'd love to see a Gweled 2 or 3.

gwhere~~~1295035344~~~Qruqs~~~2~~~It works, but has some very annoying behaviours, like it doesn't understand when the CD/DVD is changed, unless you restart the program, when searching you cannot with ease go to the found item, etc. Seems it's isn't finished. Too bad, has potential.
gwhere~~~1304178071~~~B_Tide~~~5~~~il miglio programma che abbia utilizzato per catalogare supporti rimovibili, peccato che richieda risorse estreme!
gwibber~~~1273153048~~~nilsgeylen~~~3~~~As far as Linux Twitter clients go, it's ok and it has certainly improved. Pino seems to be a big new competitor though, but I still prefer Tweetdeck with Air for now
gwibber~~~1273307377~~~Xtigyro~~~3~~~good app
gwibber~~~1273599862~~~Rich_Roast~~~4~~~Coupl'a nags but overall useful
gwibber~~~1274450476~~~isbura~~~3~~~Another below-average Twitter client for Linux. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. When it does work it has enough annoying bugs to make you wish it hadn't.
gwibber~~~1274648668~~~majortws~~~2~~~Good concept. Not great to use..
gwibber~~~1274904919~~~darkpegasus333~~~3~~~It's got decent protocol support, but it's not all that great to use.
gwibber~~~1275309217~~~RandyNose~~~2~~~Gwibber Has a nice look and feel. And then when you try to create a status update... The Keyboard response slows down to a crawl. - I can't use it, maybe others won't have this issue.
gwibber~~~1275506932~~~changke~~~3~~~slow, but not bad, a native gtk client is always better than those using adobe air
gwibber~~~1275693906~~~vorizod~~~3~~~Not an ideal, but when haven't better - we can use it. Wanna Tweetie for Linux ;-P
gwibber~~~1275926337~~~funker2010~~~3~~~upgradeable, but the concept is OK
gwibber~~~1275967207~~~Spike941~~~5~~~Works great for me.
gwibber~~~1276459415~~~thebrix~~~3~~~Good API support, but UI wastes a lot of space
gwibber~~~1278606703~~~chernobit~~~2~~~Slow and takes too many resources. With constant freezes.
gwibber~~~1279138875~~~sploopidy~~~1~~~Takes up lots of resources, confusing UI, and limited features. I'd rather use Internet Explorer to connect to facebook and twitter.
gwibber~~~1279549680~~~masoko~~~1~~~Useless
gwibber~~~1280629867~~~timloyal~~~5~~~It works for me I just like to get on and say something and get off. Great for that.
gwibber~~~1280525123~~~andriyr~~~2~~~useless
gwibber~~~1280716500~~~ivanovnegro~~~2~~~Useless.
gwibber~~~1281259509~~~AcolyteVersion1~~~2~~~Very buggy software - continually fails to add Facebook despite successful authentication.
gwibber~~~1282020937~~~robertofmj~~~1~~~Horrible, confuse, many libs and "memory ram killer". I prefer qwit client.
gwibber~~~1282031476~~~mikefreeman~~~3~~~Ok, but could be better.
gwibber~~~1291513261~~~Xyie~~~3~~~Nice for reading updates, but I can't get it to send updates.
gwibber~~~1284409674~~~shwany~~~1~~~so and so.
gwibber~~~1286895987~~~iranquintero~~~1~~~No sirve Turpial es mejor

gwibber~~~1288101194~~~Deadite81~~~2~~~This app almost correctly for me consistenty.
gwibber~~~1288279972~~~30ctsparer~~~1~~~Can't see any use or point
gwibber~~~1288601439~~~gandalf88bis~~~2~~~i think pidgin is better
gwibber~~~1288604806~~~kip-~~~1~~~useless.. i tried but after couple dont see the point specialy when refresh doesnt work correctly plus my updates doesnt appear on facebook.. i just uninstall.. its buggy.
gwibber~~~1288606023~~~punkrtekk~~~1~~~It is either too slow or it does not work at all, contains loads of bugs. Interface is not nice, either. Just a crap app.
gwibber~~~1288636081~~~frankeinstein~~~1~~~Very poor. Any alternative is a better alternative.
gwibber~~~1288899788~~~kad3t~~~2~~~Pidgin looks better, works better and... Wait for it... IS better! ^_^
gwibber~~~1289669273~~~pasdechance~~~1~~~works. doesn't work. works. doesn't work. hotot is a better twitter client and facebook is for suckers anyways
gwibber~~~1289962676~~~H4x0r18~~~2~~~Tried it, its works nice and all, but I don't need it. My Pidgin does everything for me. Thanks though.
gwibber~~~1290115716~~~angelhjose~~~2~~~No parece muy útil
gwibber~~~1290173853~~~AlkoLoiK~~~4~~~gwibber has nothing to do with pidgin! It is for microblogging (like Twitter), not for chat!... And that works good for that.
gwibber~~~1290442140~~~Theologian~~~1~~~More standard junk to remove after a fresh install/upgrade
gwibber~~~1290647666~~~squirrel-the-tire~~~2~~~Pretty pointless in my opinion.
gwibber~~~1291045942~~~Koffeehaus~~~4~~~The idea behind it is very good, and would be usefull. But the app is really heavy. Are there any alternatives?
gwibber~~~1291125980~~~KazuSpara~~~1~~~Think uninstalling of Gwibber is a little tax for using Mint.
gwibber~~~1291130275~~~wanda~~~1~~~Es lebe Pidgin ,gwibber wirt deinstalliert auf mein rechner.
gwibber~~~1291163763~~~Demiahn~~~1~~~totally useless
gwibber~~~1291455223~~~yagolf~~~2~~~completely useless for me. in my opinion this app would only be useful on smartphones.
gwibber~~~1291652518~~~bikerboi87~~~2~~~some people just don't like social networking
gwibber~~~1291702625~~~dagon~~~1~~~Too unreliable and utterly pointless.
gwibber~~~1291736869~~~adzik~~~1~~~Connects, doesn't connect (to any social network). Lacking, and no real purpose as a social app.
gwibber~~~1291898754~~~sarhan~~~1~~~useless! sry for developers :/
gwibber~~~1291926046~~~Twiguard~~~4~~~It's good to stay informed by Twitter.
gwibber~~~1292112183~~~kneekoo~~~2~~~I'm not sure this should be included by default in Linux Mint but it sure looks like many people feel it's useless. It is the same to me. I'll uninstall it right after I send my review.
gwibber~~~1292669718~~~criss84~~~1~~~unninstal this sh.t
gwibber~~~1293031863~~~joeplugg~~~4~~~Works well for me; casual checking of twitter and facbook.

gwibber~~~1294026692~~~wykedengel~~~2~~~Didn't work for me. Account info entered correctly, but nothing appeared in the main window, even after restarting the app several times.
gwibber~~~1294175855~~~guv999~~~2~~~Not very elegant.  Much easier to have launchers om your desktop or browser etc
gwibber~~~1294326260~~~lalalee~~~1~~~I can never get this app to work.
gwibber~~~1294326702~~~terix~~~1~~~I delete it immediately after the distribution
gwibber~~~1295098341~~~jhrdka~~~1~~~Waste of RAM...
gwibber~~~1295876779~~~akash211~~~1~~~It should not be present by default
gwibber~~~1296347414~~~edilsoncr~~~1~~~I like social media, but Gwibber is a bad client. You have a low number of preferences to set, no tray icon and development way too focused on Ubuntu.
gwibber~~~1296623357~~~aptidude~~~1~~~Extremely unreliable
gwibber~~~1296696403~~~Samc~~~2~~~Took a lot to make it work. Perhaps best to wait until it matures a bit
gwibber~~~1296713161~~~idefixerl~~~2~~~kann mich kein bisschen dafür begeistern
gwibber~~~1307384837~~~farocker~~~4~~~I dont have any problems ! Works good !

gwibber~~~1301833366~~~burjans~~~1~~~I prefer Turpial http://community.linuxmint.com/idea/view/1379
gwibber~~~1302025382~~~anarkii~~~3~~~could be better with some updates
gwibber~~~1302189739~~~nerjamartin~~~2~~~Must improve... a lot (minimize to tray bar doesn't work)
gwibber~~~1305064372~~~WiiLLiamDv~~~5~~~:) bueno !!
gwibber~~~1303448909~~~DaneAU~~~5~~~I love Gwibber as simple client. I was using Ubuntu and Loved the Indicator, however minimise to tray does not work on Mint. I am a little add odds, however will hold hopes for it being remedied :)
gwibber~~~1304187505~~~Belarus_IRus~~~1~~~don't work... sorry
gwibber~~~1304243291~~~xalexx~~~1~~~Sosial sechts... so sosial...
gwibber~~~1304535923~~~gozer~~~2~~~gwibber is up to version 3, but LMDE only has 1.2. The newer versions are great. This one not so much.
gwibber~~~1304805021~~~jondkent~~~2~~~Works, but not pretty
gwibber~~~1304963274~~~zerocool652~~~5~~~L'ho trovo fantastico!!
gwibber~~~1305041975~~~birkopf~~~1~~~Stupid, and stubborn, lots of errors no way to contact developers.
gwibber~~~1305703045~~~CDEX~~~3~~~Termina siendo un dolor de cabeza... recibiendo mensajes y mensajes y mensajes... funciona... pero no te recomiendo usarlo a menos que tengas muuuuucho tiempo libre.
gwibber~~~1306188517~~~Germmare~~~2~~~pidgin is my favorite
gwibber~~~1306220198~~~fothergillr~~~3~~~Clunky, stubborn and messy: Does the job, but at the cost of your patience.
gwibber~~~1307087360~~~magicbus~~~2~~~Had serious problems setting it up. It gave me lots of errors. Ended up dumping Facebook, so now I use Hotot.
gwibber~~~1307088423~~~CBindahouse~~~4~~~I use it, it seems fine for updating Twitter. It doesn't do realtime updating though :(
gwibber~~~1307847612~~~dumsterdave~~~3~~~ehh, nothing special.. gives me errors a lot when i try to use it
gwibber~~~1308371844~~~mitanshugamer~~~2~~~really not a fan..
gwibber~~~1309459444~~~AlbertP~~~4~~~Great software for faster tweeting. But you first have to get used to it.
gwibber~~~1309604646~~~mante~~~5~~~Works just great!
gwibber~~~1310130991~~~rocker~~~1~~~error :-@
gwibber~~~1310132047~~~SeventhReign~~~2~~~Does what it claims .. sometimes.  Not sure if its the worst client available, but its close too it.
gwibber~~~1311752520~~~numn~~~5~~~Once you get the hang of it its a really nice tool. Its simple, quick,  it supports other socialmedia sites, desktopnotifications when you get new messages, crossplattform communication... it has everything i expect of a client!
gwibber~~~1312333460~~~blueXrider~~~2~~~Junk
gwibber~~~1312631452~~~marksuci~~~1~~~Katastrofa
gwibber~~~1314713176~~~anonymous_object~~~1~~~Pretty terrible as a Twitter client. Too few config options, takes up too much desktop space, and themes are weak. Also, fastest refresh time is 5 minutes...
gwibber~~~1315167673~~~drakeos~~~1~~~Sorry but really bad.
gwibber~~~1315527054~~~mjoens41~~~1~~~very buggy, it uses crazy cpu, very often, facebook does not work

gwibber-service~~~1290712426~~~yagolf~~~1~~~sorry, but this app doesn't do it for me. it's not clear and the layout is not friendly enough for me
gworldclock~~~1297353843~~~Twix2247~~~3~~~Allows you to view a list of time zones you choose so you can customize it to your needs slightly, which is helpful for me.  Can be viewed in 24 or 12 hr format with date.  Simple program that works as asdvertised.
gworldclock~~~1315365128~~~akaawol~~~5~~~It's awesome, Like it says it lists all the time zones you want, but I like that you can customize it. Even name the zones based on your friend's name who lives there.

hamster-applet~~~1275803257~~~nivapo~~~5~~~Very good program!
hamster-applet~~~1298157954~~~Xyie~~~5~~~This program looks very good for keeping track of how much time you spend on different things, and may just show you how much time you're wasting playing that video game... er... it may let you prove to the boss how must time you've been spending on your projects.

handbrake-gtk~~~1279033487~~~alexandrum77~~~5~~~I ripped my entire 70 DVD collection to .mkv with 2-3 audio tracks in original formats like DTS and AC3. This is the best ripper ever! I compared the rips with the original dvd, you can't tell the difference.
handbrake-gtk~~~1281908491~~~JasonLG~~~5~~~Best mp4 DVD ripper.
handbrake-gtk~~~1281908657~~~danstinebaugh~~~5~~~Love it for transcoding my .mkv files to .m4v so my PS3 will play them. Quality is awesome!

icewm~~~1270926031~~~Roin~~~5~~~Fast and simple Windows Manager, I just love it!
icewm~~~1280491478~~~elscripto~~~4~~~One of the best window managers around - simple, blazing fast and easily configurable by text files. If you need to fit your GUI within 40 MB of used memory, then IceWm is the best choice directly on top of the X server. In combination with pure LXDE you may fit within 100 MB of used memory. However medium to advanced linux experience is needed to set it up and running properly.
icewm~~~1284953329~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Light and quick for a desktop/window manager, but be sure you're not afraid of tinkering with config files to customize it your way. Easy enough to figure out for an intermediate user. Adventurous beginners only.

id3v2~~~1283553139~~~AcolyteVersion1~~~5~~~Great, lightweight and simple tool for editing ID3v2 tags.
idea-ic~~~1275861101~~~opticyclic~~~5~~~Outstrips all other Java IDEs including Netbeans and eclipse. This free version doesn't include J2EE features though. http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html

idle-python2.6~~~1285243770~~~Laan~~~5~~~I use it in windows and linux, and i simple find it to good and light in both systems that i cant give it less of 5
idle-python2.6~~~1288441282~~~ItDontMeanAThing~~~3~~~Easy to use because it doesn't do much.  Sometimes doesn't recognize code changes.  Work around is to delete .pyc files.  When that fails, exit and restart IDLE.

ike-qtgui~~~1292245332~~~richardstreet~~~5~~~This is a brilliant cross-platform GUI tool for connecting to the firewall's IPSec VPNs and appliances. No need to get tied up in configuring racoon, ipsec tools and so on - just type in the values in the appropriate places and click connect. Works like a charm. You can easily export working policies to distribute around others using this client through Linux/Windows/Mac/BSD versions of the product.

inkscape~~~1271356768~~~captainhaggy~~~5~~~Vor 15 Jahren hätte man wohl Corel Draw benutzt ... für viel Geld. Aber heute ist es so viel einfacher. Inskcape ist kostenlos und ein exzellentes Programm für all jene Menschen, die Corel, MicroGrafix oder ähnliches gewohnt sind.Vektorzeichnen at it's best.
inkscape~~~1273153237~~~nilsgeylen~~~5~~~It's not part of a big suite like Illustrator is so it cannot be compared in that way. As a standalone vector app it rocks and removes the need for any paid (and overpriced) commercial alternative

inkscape~~~1287477445~~~titohal~~~4~~~Useful software. There are, IMHO, two issues: the interface and stability. The pannels for the interface soulb be dockable together, it would make Inkscape more user-friendly. And some tools make Inkscape crash too often.

inkscape~~~1288481538~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~What I like most about InkScape is you don't have to be a professional to be able to use it but still manage to do something very nice. On top of that, it's open source and actively developed so I wish the developers all the best. Thank you!

jabref~~~1281774373~~~NfG84~~~4~~~Comfortable tool to keep all the papers ordered. It has a online search for article, but many journals are not supported.
jabref~~~1286101777~~~alaak~~~4~~~Unfortunately you need to enter most data by hand. This gives good control on small bibliographys but is tedious if you have many references. In the second case I prefer Mendeley Desktop available as *.deb package as well.
jabref~~~1290305074~~~FunkyWhale~~~4~~~I tried many, this beats all. Very consistent. Lives well with your hand-generated bib files as well.

jedit~~~1314284667~~~L0r3nz0~~~4~~~Nice!
jeex~~~1292535715~~~dagon~~~2~~~This is a clean, non-buggy hex editor. In my opinion it has a couple of big drawbacks. 1: I expect to find a row to the left indicating where in the file I am... not implemented. 2: Even though you can examine the output in different formats such as ascii... for some reason it isn't presented with the hexcode but opens up in a separate window. I usually wan't the two to be correlated.

This takes some knowledge to set it up properly and make it look polished. There is much config file editing ahead if you wish to make it pretty. Recommended for intermediate to advanced users.

kbounce~~~1275158265~~~AndrewX192~~~5~~~It's just like the Jezzball game for windows back in the 1990s.

kcm-touchpad~~~1299273183~~~frederic-mohr~~~3~~~Drei Sterne weil ichs leider nicht wirklich beurteilen kann da es nicht auffindbar war... System: Dell Latitude E6410, Mint 10 Gnome - Habs leider nicht gefunden nach der installation. War im Menü nicht auffindbar. Aptitude zeigte das packet als installiert an (Status: Dummy, real package kde-config-touchpad) auch kde-config-touchpad wurde als installiert angezeigt. Keins der beiden konnte übers Terminal oder Menü gestartet/gefunden werden

kde-full~~~1307815441~~~menta1789~~~5~~~ESTA MUY BIEN EL PAQUETE POR QUE TE TRAI TODO EN UN PAQUETE QUE OS PARACE PERO AY BESES QUE KDE TIENE PLOBLEMAS CON EL SONIDO
kde-full~~~1308948117~~~blueXrider~~~1~~~Very sad, very slow, extreamily bloated just like WINDOWS 7. It's resource hungry and I can't stand it. I even tried to use it on a VM but it was terrible.
kde-full~~~1309760861~~~trollboy~~~2~~~I don't actually know why I don't like KDE. I just don't like it. It can only be the overall feel of the thing in use.
kde-full~~~1309764400~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Cool! ;)
kde-full~~~1312029914~~~mintlinux~~~2~~~It's not really the best. When I set my desktop enviornment to KDE, I con't find any traces of linux mint, and, it adds too much junk to your computer that bloats it up.

kdenlive~~~1271330059~~~mixedbredie~~~4~~~Best video editor I have used on linux. Can import multiple formats and render/export to a huge variety with control over size and quality. Learning curve is a bit steep but there are good tutorials on the website. All I need is more time...

kdenlive~~~1294935731~~~grim~~~4~~~Best video editor on Linux? :D
kdenlive~~~1296464309~~~fanisatt~~~3~~~There are a lot of crashes......
kdenlive~~~1296941337~~~cmaew04~~~4~~~This program works fantastic! I am able to do all the fancy editing I would like to do. The only downturn is that I keep getting an error that my home file is not accessible. Other than that its a complete thumbs up!
kdenlive~~~1301144934~~~jasonjohnwells~~~4~~~save often
kdenlive~~~1301855009~~~bentinc~~~5~~~Has some instablity issues (getting better). Anyway, the best video editor for Linux if you need more than PiTiVi has to offer. Does not need KDE to run, just some KDE-libraries but it  works with GNOME just as well!
kdenlive~~~1304512568~~~dinolib~~~5~~~The best NLE I've never used
kdenlive~~~1306818849~~~JackWelch55~~~5~~~Great video editor! Check out the Light Graffiti filter.

kdesvn~~~1320670534~~~pixel293~~~3~~~I liked it better when I had a KDE environmetn setup.  Under GNOME it's okay, and seems to be better than the other GUIs.  My biggest problem with it lately is that functionality is hid under two different sub menus, and remembering which one is a pain.
kdevplatform1-libs~~~1297584535~~~Elisa~~~4~~~Useful as 'kdevelop' when wanna play with python ;)
kdiff3~~~1301074145~~~Piilen~~~5~~~Also works under gnome not just KDE
kdiff3~~~1301077570~~~wanda~~~3~~~there's also a stripped-down version called kdiff3-qt not depending on the kde libraries , better.

kget~~~1311224897~~~ali20~~~4~~~its the best download manager for linux.its too fast
kget~~~1312271208~~~linuxali~~~5~~~its better than gwget
kget~~~1315287934~~~amkidnumber4~~~4~~~great! :D
kgoldrunner~~~1293074129~~~wchsmathman14~~~5~~~I played Lode Runner on my Commodore 64 when I was a kid...this game is very similar.
kgpg~~~1278235896~~~punkrtekk~~~4~~~Seems to be better and easier to use than Gnome tools...
kgpg~~~1307309688~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Very good!
kicad~~~1291539699~~~DJPhil~~~5~~~A great place to start learning EDA software. Open source, so no restrictions like Eagle. Best for simpler designs using through hole or single sided boards. 3D preview and hundreds of footprints and models in the community. Less flexible than gEDA, but easier to learn.
kiconedit~~~1298251572~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~good. for edit icon. & create icon .
kid3-qt~~~1274647806~~~almar~~~4~~~Works in an intuitive way.
kid3-qt~~~1278036424~~~masoko~~~5~~~Muy bueno,para aquel que quiere etiquetar sus .mp3's es esencial
kid3-qt~~~1280017080~~~aneurysm1985~~~3~~~Sorry, but I couldn't get the hang of this one. The functionality was not intuitive for me. Am using the excellent free Mp3tag software through WINE instead.
kid3-qt~~~1288737587~~~30ctsparer~~~4~~~The best Audio and ID3 tagging tool is "Audio Tag Tool"
kid3-qt~~~1290104298~~~ExoDoom~~~2~~~No es muy intuitivo, pero una vez trasteas un poco con él, hace lo que se supone que debe hacer
kid3-qt~~~1315700407~~~damirv~~~5~~~Better than Easytag - more options.
kid3-qt~~~1321796704~~~Hithlinel~~~3~~~Although I like this app I was frustrated that the maximum track number is 255. For multi-CD albums I use for example 0516 to represent CD 5 track 16. Not currently possible in this app.
kiki~~~1296273782~~~InverseHypercube~~~5~~~This is a great little tool. It's invaluable if you use regex.
kiki~~~1308519052~~~UncleNinja~~~5~~~Extremely useful.
kile~~~1281677269~~~dbpatankar~~~4~~~So far, after trying many (La)tex editors, nothing can beat kile when it comes to user interface. Includes many features and command completion along with newly added word completion is awesome when you sit for writing thesis. Only Texmaker comes closer to it.
kile~~~1295657198~~~InverseHypercube~~~5~~~Excellent feature-filled LaTeX editor. It has quick PDF export, but is not WYSIWYG, meaning you learn LaTeX syntax. It also saves in standard .tex files unlike LyX, which is a big plus.
kile~~~1314621831~~~MajorGrubert~~~4~~~Fonctionne assez bien et très pratique malgré le côté usine à gaz
kile~~~1322148730~~~IgnatiusReilly~~~5~~~The best LaTeX editor
kino~~~1272919936~~~albert22~~~5~~~Kino is probably the best Linux video editor that I have used: 1. It doesn't crash often 2. It has many many features not found elsewhere 3. It is well documented 4. It captures video 5. It's interface is intuitive and doesn't resemble a 1980's video arcade game or Windows. For example, show me an editor with a 'dvtitler' that actually works, is previewed live and can stick the time and date of the footage onto the frame(s), other than Kino?
kino~~~1288215572~~~30ctsparer~~~4~~~It's easy to use, but comes with very limited features. I like OpenShot better.
kino~~~1296763092~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Very cool :-)
kino~~~1296770952~~~wanda~~~3~~~It's easy to use, but comes with very limited features. I like OpenShot better. < my to.
kino~~~1303293498~~~Yuri~~~3~~~Yes, limited features
kipi-plugins~~~1316831385~~~Kain~~~5~~~Makes digikam more useful.
kismet~~~1277363435~~~axel668~~~5~~~Nice simple WLAN tool

kismet~~~1295387805~~~kip-~~~5~~~:)
kismet~~~1296716339~~~furcalor~~~5~~~One of the best, if not the best tool for discovering WIFI networks.
kismet~~~1300932203~~~miana~~~1~~~Kismet doesn't show up in my laptop, and I cannot find Kismet anywhere in my laptop. It doesn't show up after I restarted laptop either. So I think this app is useless.
kismet~~~1310733962~~~linuxnpl~~~2~~~not shown in start menu
kismet~~~1316281988~~~rwttaber~~~5~~~I use the version from kismets site, as the Ubuntu repos have stoped updating it. Everyone who sais they can't find the application should not be using it.
kiso~~~1291224329~~~Antil0ck~~~5~~~makes ripping and creating ISO images a snap!
klamav~~~1291572898~~~kardin~~~4~~~simple but more advanced than clamtk
klavaro~~~1273957246~~~Esteis~~~4~~~Big points for the number of languages and layouts supported, and the ability to work with any new layout you specify. Minus-points for the didactic method being sub-optimal. Still usuable as practice material, though. Bonus points for 'no enforcement': you can skip back or ahead to any lesson you wish.
klavaro~~~1274917926~~~Canid~~~3~~~Funciona, tá valendo!!!
klavaro~~~1281968895~~~flor_de_azucena~~~4~~~There're not many typing tutors that support Russian, and Klavaro is the best of them. Even my 70-year old dad can type now with good speed.
klavaro~~~1283984018~~~5_O_Clock_Charlie~~~4~~~Seems pretty good so far !
klavaro~~~1296531456~~~Xyie~~~5~~~Graphical typing tutor beyond the command-line one I tried. It doesn't need much else installed under gtk. The interface is very simple but not skimping on the features, so it is neither distracting nor intimidating.
klavaro~~~1299467751~~~derschreckliche~~~4~~~a bit monotonous in the beginning but helps to develop "good habits"
klavaro~~~1312059191~~~efthialex~~~5~~~Very handy
klibido~~~1271688923~~~MintHat~~~5~~~A very good program
klipper~~~1275603773~~~AndrewX192~~~5~~~Great tool for managing your clipboard, lets you have multiple items and select between them and clear entrys.

kmahjongg~~~1313576530~~~prativasic~~~5~~~Its the really the best tile based solitire mahjongg game ever!
kmail~~~1271330839~~~mixedbredie~~~4~~~I switched from Thunderbird 2.x to Thunderbird 3.x to Kmail with KDE 4.4.2 on Helena and find it a much easier client to use then TB3. The online documentation is good and the integration iwith the rest of KDE means everything just works. I like the spam and virus wizards and the options to create comprehensive filters for incoming mail. I use it with three IMAP accounts. Together with Digikam and Firefox my most used application.
kmail~~~1287238922~~~nkspro~~~5~~~Much better customization than tb, easy navigation, good features and better adapted in kde environ
kmail~~~1308991749~~~ugubabba~~~5~~~my favorite mail client on kde / as part of kde pim
kmail~~~1312550476~~~nipu011~~~5~~~great
kmail~~~1313065523~~~luxy~~~5~~~I Love it. Very easy to handle.
kmess~~~1278305705~~~nexus_mty~~~4~~~good messenger clone
kmess~~~1278307377~~~baffle-boy~~~5~~~the very best MSN Messenger clone for linux. unlike the other ones, it offers ALL of the windows MSN's features (winks, etc.) and its made for KDE!
kmess~~~1281101751~~~mandripost~~~4~~~Bon client qui s'intègre bien dans KDE

kmidimon~~~1272489120~~~Alexio~~~4~~~Especially useful if you want to debug MIDI software or your MIDI setup.
kmix~~~1275158439~~~AndrewX192~~~4~~~Nice sound mixer, allows you to mute sound by middle clicking on the tray icon.
kmobiletools~~~1298090997~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~very good, but sometimes disconnected with HSDPA usb stick & can not, to delete the sms.
kmplayer~~~1299533679~~~will_iron~~~5~~~me encanta
kmplot~~~1299828171~~~Reigenspieler~~~5~~~In my opinion the best plotter for Linux.
kmplot~~~1304509810~~~Topen~~~4~~~Great for 2D plots but can't do 3D plots
kmplot~~~1315765655~~~carlosjimy~~~5~~~Excelente graficador. Todo tipo de funciones en 2D con una presentación elegante y práctica.

kmymoney2~~~1275741767~~~houkiboshi~~~4~~~Easy to manage our budget and finance!
kmymoney2~~~1282356318~~~dequire~~~5~~~MS Money and Quicken have nothing on this great KDE SC application. A real unknown gem that I use daily.
kmymoney2~~~1283514702~~~yahtzeek9~~~4~~~Great software!!!
kmymoney2~~~1287592808~~~jolouis32~~~5~~~merveilleux
kmymoney2~~~1287595646~~~kenutch~~~2~~~Do the developers of this software not realize Canada speaks English as well, useless in French only for Bank info...
kmymoney2~~~1287609743~~~pubmania~~~5~~~It's absolutely great tool...:)
kmymoney2~~~1295984123~~~efthialex~~~4~~~Makes its job!
kmymoney2~~~1304858192~~~ashtoash~~~3~~~Useless
kmymoney2~~~1308988538~~~ugubabba~~~5~~~nice kde finance program, as most kde apps, very feature rich - so you have to work yourself into it a little. when you do - awesomeness.
kmymoney2~~~1314199325~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~Better than M$ Money
kmymoney2~~~1315380606~~~MarkX~~~5~~~Awesome! Thanks, runs just as good under Gnome as it does my KDE machine.

koffice~~~1281561216~~~donald_duck~~~5~~~Pour une intégration parfaite avec le bureau kde
koffice~~~1301564781~~~jasonjohnwells~~~5~~~a refreshing alternative between MS Office style bloat and Google Docs.  Nice to keep Libre Office around to convert to userland formats.  I'm looking forward to watching for developments from the Calligra team.  My phone runs Maemo and I was looking forward to MeeGo with Calligra and Kontact sync someday but now I'm stuck using Android for mobile and concerned for the future of open source in a mobile world.
kolourpaint4~~~1272268520~~~unexistance~~~4~~~For people who is very used to MS Paint (it a bit more advanced), it's perfect. The downside is the dependencies it pulled-in :P
kolourpaint4~~~1274527805~~~agnard~~~4~~~a great little program. just bad it shuts down from time to time:(
kolourpaint4~~~1290740662~~~Doruletz~~~5~~~I LOVE IT! Awesome image editing tool. Similar to but better than Win 7 Paint. Not as complex or complete as Gimp, but great none the less.

kolourpaint4~~~1294757844~~~timewasted~~~5~~~I agree that it is better than most versions of MS Paint. Awesome replacement for llinx users.
kolourpaint4~~~1297190757~~~Xyie~~~5~~~Great for a quick doodle! Sometimes it's all you need for a simple graphic. When you don't need fancy, but need to draw, this works nicely.
kolourpaint4~~~1315312617~~~Derathor~~~5~~~A great replacement for MS Paint!
kolourpaint4~~~1316832472~~~Kain~~~5~~~Sure, it's very limited, but sometimes you don't need gimp. Just like ms paint, but better!
kompare~~~1276736554~~~prietocwb~~~4~~~looks very pleasing. will try it for a while.
kompozer~~~1269760116~~~ddalley~~~4~~~KompoZer is a separate fork of the old Netscape 7.2 suite. It, along with SeaMonkey's Composer, are the two to use. Two very good 4.01 HTML editors for static web pages. Ignore nvu because it is dead code and buggy.

kompozer~~~1296801469~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Very useful when I don't want to trudge through html code to edit my web page. A few bugs here and there still, but you learn what to avoid.
kompozer~~~1297460884~~~leonwolff~~~5~~~????? dreamweaver !
kompozer~~~1297466795~~~Elisa~~~3~~~No big deal... :-\ (Portable) Dreamweaver ;-) is 10x better :P

konqueror~~~1275120260~~~AndrewX192~~~4~~~I never use konqueror for web browsing, but it does a great job at file management.
konqueror~~~1279250051~~~Fuzzi99~~~4~~~It's good for file managment and document viewing but not very good for web browsing
konqueror~~~1281030154~~~ivanovnegro~~~3~~~It does a good job. But I really prefer other browsers over it.
konqueror~~~1281908183~~~dbpatankar~~~3~~~I use as a file browser but not for web browsing.
konqueror~~~1282594041~~~Raven95~~~5~~~My Favorite Web Browser Also Brilliant For File Management And Document Viewing
konqueror~~~1282812492~~~bobthedog~~~4~~~Great file manager. Slow as a browsar, but much faster if you use the webkit rendering engine rather than khtml - switch it in the drop down menus.
konqueror~~~1286583570~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~good for file browser.
konqueror~~~1299182608~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Good web browser ;)
konqueror~~~1290379553~~~glen20~~~5~~~Still the best KDE file manager.
konqueror~~~1290694063~~~shaon121~~~5~~~good
konqueror~~~1291592993~~~Sol_Badguy~~~4~~~Very nice...
konqueror~~~1293323591~~~Shostako~~~3~~~Better file manager than web browser, but not the best.
konqueror~~~1293535729~~~ratick~~~3~~~simple web browser, but not the best
konqueror~~~1294936350~~~grim~~~4~~~Good
konqueror~~~1312375410~~~sigurd1701~~~4~~~simple, poerful but not that convenient
konqueror~~~1312555372~~~krzystoff~~~2~~~tries to be many things, but fails to excel at any of them
konqueror~~~1313644753~~~Labby~~~3~~~Not a horrible web browser, but I prefer Chromium or even FireFox. I give it a so so!
konqueror~~~1315394042~~~mintrenarr~~~5~~~ganz spezielle Möglichkeiten, Fenssterteilungen horizontal und vertikal, Datei- wie Webbrowser, universelles Ding !
konqueror~~~1316728573~~~Examiner~~~4~~~I like it - a lot! The only things that I do not like, are that it is not terribly user-friendly when attempting to sort bookmarks, and the font size on my email is laughable. However, it is fast, clean, and easy on the eyes.
konquest~~~1296963768~~~Xyie~~~4~~~I must admit, I've spent a bit too much time on this game before.
konquest~~~1296972734~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Really quite adictive.
konquest~~~1298556303~~~Tuhin~~~5~~~Addictive! Don't try this game LOL!
konsole~~~1271332630~~~mixedbredie~~~4~~~I like using the konsole. Transparent black background, bright green text, tab completion - It's like it's 1988 again.
konsole~~~1275345591~~~AndrewX192~~~5~~~Powerful terminal emulator with plenty of themes.
konsole~~~1280005491~~~ledjin~~~5~~~I really love it.
konsole~~~1297390791~~~mutput7~~~5~~~My life would NOT be the same without it.
konsole~~~1298558751~~~Googleness~~~5~~~The only terminal emulator which work for me using Hebrew and RTL support.

kontact~~~1318334986~~~stleon~~~5~~~Like it
konversation~~~1297189787~~~Xyie~~~4~~~This is a pretty decent irc client for using while in kde. Very little to be overwhelmed or confused with, but neither lacking in features.
konversation~~~1308583678~~~Ioseph~~~5~~~My fave.
konversation~~~1308587958~~~SeventhReign~~~4~~~The best GUI based IRC client for KDE.  Quassel is just a complete mess ATM.
kopete~~~1267675790~~~GhoS~~~4~~~Very nice all around messenger
kopete~~~1279946487~~~LinuxWiz83~~~5~~~This is probably the best all in one messenger for linux but the only thing that would be nice for it would be facebook and myspace chat
kopete~~~1280221294~~~dequire~~~4~~~A lot of features, but KMess is better if you only use MSN for chatting. Also their homepage @ http://kopete.kde.org isn't updated enough. Still a great KDE Chat Client. "Supports AIM, ICQ, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, Novell GroupWise Messenger, and more"
kopete~~~1285262785~~~titohal~~~4~~~Supports many protocols. Some more settings about emoticons and interface would be great. But I think it's the best chat client.
kopete~~~1286026583~~~makifruti~~~2~~~Pero tiene una interface muy amigable y simple!
kopete~~~1288801121~~~realpipster~~~3~~~No Video...needs Jasper. Not sure what that is
kopete~~~1291552373~~~ice-beam~~~4~~~Much more configurable than Pidgin or Empathy, and more nice-looking too.
kopete~~~1291593292~~~Sol_Badguy~~~4~~~Nice :p
kopete~~~1296646311~~~catalin~~~4~~~nice
kopete~~~1300211178~~~SL0WD0WN~~~5~~~Sollten viel mehr Leute benutzen!
kopete~~~1300573029~~~antonio_barros~~~5~~~Ótimo cliente de mensagem instantânea.
kopete~~~1306871222~~~slw_~~~3~~~A little to complicate for my taste. A little bit to many options that I really do not have need for. Works fine though.
kopete~~~1307309466~~~Elisa~~~4~~~Good
korganizer~~~1306923306~~~RytronII~~~4~~~This is by far my favorite calendar app in GNU/Linux.
korganizer~~~1307138208~~~mantalos~~~5~~~At last a professional calendar! Just like iCal. But graphics need some improvements.
koverartist~~~1283944824~~~fanisatt~~~5~~~Very - very simple and useful
kpackagekit~~~1282537936~~~dequire~~~3~~~Good to see it's it's getting better...
kpackagekit~~~1287525887~~~Inoki~~~5~~~Very handy for keeping your system updated. Does tasks such as critical system update without you having to do it manually. Also, if you need to browse for multiple packages from a specific file, you'll find them all in one place.
kpat~~~1304804159~~~DoItYourself~~~5~~~Kpat Klondike Solitaire is the finest computer solitaire program that I know of.
kpat~~~1281107835~~~dlkreations~~~5~~~Love these games! A lot better than what comes with Windows! The animations are a lot smoother and the gameplay just seems more fluid.
kpat~~~1308093604~~~smag~~~5~~~Goode graphic, a lot of games. I love this package.
kphotoalbum~~~1309492533~~~blueXrider~~~3~~~Didn't care for it, no frills, loads KDE lib files on system Don't care for KDE Bloatware
kq~~~1282076786~~~asymmetros~~~1~~~ried it from two different pc's. Awful exprerience. Both the times, the game seems to play by itself. I couldn 't stop it, i was not able to open a terminal or to change desktop at least.
krdc~~~1277766364~~~oguz~~~4~~~Most smart VNC client I tried. But at RDP Gnome-RDP is better.
krdc~~~1279554939~~~stewb~~~4~~~I use this daily to connect with a WindowsXP macxhine running UltraVNC. Krdc does this better than the Gnome client.
krdc~~~1289156145~~~Txnca~~~5~~~Excellent remote desktop client.  I use this to log into my XP box using rdp.  Allows resizing of the main window so that you can still see what you are doing on your Mint desktop.  Only one I've found that will do that.  Very fast and responsive.
krename~~~1272474517~~~Alexio~~~4~~~Useful for renaming pictures by number, it can do MP3s by tag and other stuff too.
krename~~~1274221666~~~kip-~~~5~~~this is very powerful stuff... should be on install disk of every distros
krename~~~1274303204~~~punkrtekk~~~5~~~Awesome tool! Hope there will be some Gnome version at some point.
krename~~~1277692686~~~shemcphe~~~5~~~Love it!  Easy, fast and powerful - I use it everyday.
krename~~~1280427923~~~turin13~~~4~~~Simply good. Integrates into your KDE.
krename~~~1281292779~~~Apehanger~~~5~~~Tried the rest, this one's the best.

lbreakout2~~~1314704344~~~trollboy~~~4~~~Simple and fun
lbreakout2~~~1319573789~~~AlmightyDoerOfStuff~~~1~~~Too many controls, too many options, unnecessary multiplayer modes. (I don't see the draw of a four-player Breakout deathmatch. Maybe it's just me.) Way too much... STUFF, for what should be a simple, fun timewaster game. The graphics are creepy and unpleasant. Furthermore, the balls turned red at one point and then the game just quit two seconds later. Not what I want from a Breakout clone. I prefer gnome-breakout, despite its age and half-finishedness.

lshw-gtk~~~1275157712~~~AndrewX192~~~3~~~Not the best interface and usability, but shows a lot of information. try "sudo lshw-gtk" if it complains about not being able to gather information as a normal user.
lshw-gtk~~~1276436065~~~afterburner~~~5~~~very nice one, more tools like this one would be nice
lshw-gtk~~~1285791247~~~ceptor~~~5~~~mächtiges info-tool für techniker und supporter
lshw-gtk~~~1290806367~~~Deadite81~~~4~~~Good tool for getting detailed hardware info.  Hardinfo is much more comprehensive, but this one's good too.
lshw-gtk~~~1295984252~~~efthialex~~~3~~~(y)
lshw-gtk~~~1301256272~~~Jac978~~~4~~~simple front-end
lshw-gtk~~~1307598328~~~Dreamcast000~~~5~~~Muuy bueno! Recomendable para saber la info de tu Hardware!
lshw-gtk~~~1309274649~~~MestreLion~~~4~~~Very nice! And truly hardware-oriented, unlike hardinfo, which focus way too much on software side (I dont care about free memory, IP connections, filesystems or kernel modules - I want to know my memory manufacturer, model, clock, etc!)
lshw-gtk~~~1314199314~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~Needed
lshw-gtk~~~1320530101~~~Lugshar~~~4~~~It's a very good app though!
lskat~~~1313312876~~~joydeep~~~4~~~very good game
ltris~~~1277364840~~~axel668~~~5~~~Great lightweight Tetris game
ltris~~~1290577199~~~Boringbytes~~~4~~~I wasn't expecting much from this game at first " Ho-hum, another Tetris type game...and it doesnt even have a re-sizable window, it's probably going to be boring." But I was wrong.  Despite the small non re-sizable window this game will keep you amused and help you waste your precious time for hours.  : )
ltsp-server~~~1285049427~~~ceptor~~~5~~~genialer terminalserver. nutzen wir sehr gerne als terminalserver unter debian oder als grundlage fuer einen pxe-boot-server
lua5.1~~~1283885414~~~panthar~~~5~~~lua is awesome

luckybackup~~~1284679294~~~foxesglacier~~~5~~~Excellent and advanced backup utility
luckybackup~~~1290806589~~~Deadite81~~~4~~~Good backup utility with advanced features.  The way the settings are can be a bit off putting though.
luckybackup~~~1291107920~~~AlkoLoiK~~~4~~~Works fast and well. But not very user-friendly nor eye-candy. i have got a problem with the deleting files on the destination : it doesn't works when the check box is on.  Too bad, it's exactly the feature i'm looking for!...
luckybackup~~~1292544211~~~hellnest~~~5~~~make rsync more easy to use :)
luckybackup~~~1294900599~~~DIONISIS_POLITIS~~~4~~~it works just fine. simple and effective.

luckybackup~~~1314199383~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~Works like it should
luckybackup~~~1312063806~~~Germmare~~~4~~~... i give it a try
luckybackup~~~1314241951~~~jajodo~~~5~~~More options than GRSYNC.  Great.
luckybackup~~~1315977121~~~minti~~~3~~~Lots of options, however, it would not allow to select destination from network drive or hidden file/folder, which may be a mounted NAS. Grsync works with network drives.
luckybackup~~~1321562800~~~kurgan~~~5~~~very good
luckybackup~~~1322059699~~~chassum~~~3~~~would be better if network drives were allowed
lvm2~~~1275260903~~~m_o_e~~~5~~~must have
lvm2~~~1277781312~~~inhuman_4~~~5~~~Makes working with partitions seem antiquated. Must have for any system with a lot of storage space.

lxde~~~1314199219~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~Simple and yet works great
lxde~~~1314225599~~~rijnsma~~~5~~~Very nice desktop environment! It looks a little like Gnome 2.x and could be a great, speedy, light alternative..
lxde~~~1322085347~~~nagalman~~~4~~~Very lightweight and speedy, doesn't have the smoothness of gnome though
lxde-icon-theme~~~1308582553~~~gianpv~~~5~~~nice, fresh and Kde-style icon's
lxdm~~~1313100297~~~galen~~~5~~~fast good code
lxpanel~~~1272473546~~~Alexio~~~4~~~Because Openbox users need to dump PyPanel.
lxpanel~~~1281806507~~~stimuli~~~5~~~My fav panel for openbox. Useful, pretty, easy to tweak.
lxpanel~~~1300884861~~~m4daredsun~~~5~~~A bit unfriendly when you try to configure it at the very beginning, but then it becomes a great tool. I suggest to use it with Openbox and PCManFM to create your custom lightweight desktop environment
lxsession-edit~~~1294076135~~~gianpv~~~5~~~the same application of gnome-session for LXDE desktop, usefull
lxterminal~~~1281806844~~~stimuli~~~4~~~Nice, light, fast terminal. Could use a few more options.
lxterminal~~~1287590947~~~m4daredsun~~~5~~~I like it as it is: the lightest and the fastest
lxterminal~~~1303130958~~~RamboRan~~~5~~~Mr Burns said it :).
lybniz~~~1285176520~~~gesthal~~~5~~~Lightweight.Really handy for a student like me.
lynx~~~1276923995~~~khai~~~1~~~Is still anybody using text browsers?
lynx~~~1282583697~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Good for accessing web pages from the terminal.  Solid and reliable, if you're looking for a text browser. Not the easiest to nagivate at first, but much smoother once navigation is learned.
lynx~~~1279926820~~~clem~~~5~~~Really handy if you need text-based browsing
lynx~~~1282728608~~~deBassplayer~~~4~~~fast. specially for text base information with lack of internet connection or small bandwith
lynx~~~1282731056~~~linux1492~~~4~~~Its good to have a text based browser in case you find yourself in troubles with X applications. Yes, it is good to have, same as it is good to have vim for a quick job on a script. Lynx is beating in terms of speed and basic internet requirements. Defently, it has its drawbacks based on the handling, but again this is only a question of experience with the application!
lynx~~~1282736337~~~French~~~5~~~Lynx a fine text based browser,take a look at my weblog http://frenchsite.wordpress.com/2009/06/21/webbrowser-in-de-terminal/
lynx~~~1288876543~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Cool :)
lynx~~~1291767425~~~merelyjim~~~5~~~There's a lot of stuff on the web that I can live without. When I go to a news site, I almost feel assulted by pics and video trying to grab more attention than the printed words. Lynx resolves this issue. Another win for the command line...
lynx~~~1295203212~~~Shostako~~~4~~~A good browser for the fanatics of CLI
lynx~~~1303369992~~~Fastraxx~~~5~~~I love this browser!
lynx~~~1303372217~~~wanda~~~2~~~Anybody using text browsers??.
lynx~~~1307818757~~~creation~~~5~~~nice browser when want to surf the web without banners; @wanda many people use text browsers
lynx~~~1311941439~~~RavS~~~3~~~Fun to try out, but I don't find it too useful.
lynx~~~1318835523~~~madalieninvader~~~2~~~"elinks" or "links2" are easier to use and prettier. only plus for lynx is that it might be better documented.

lyx~~~1275645340~~~Tar-Minyatur~~~5~~~Since I found LyX I use it for almost everything. It's easy to use and produces very well presentable results. In some cases you need to dive into some messy details, but it's totally worth it.
lyx~~~1278332031~~~Klein1965~~~5~~~El mejor editor WYSIWYM (Lo que ves es lo que quieres decir) para LaTeX. El trabajo se hace más productivo y los resultados son profesionales.

lyx~~~1284742340~~~mjjzf~~~4~~~LyX is a remarkable tool which makes the muscles of the LaTeX system available for anyone. While there is no doubt it requires a bit of getting used to, your documents will be power user quality once you get into the mindset.
lyx~~~1288215042~~~30ctsparer~~~5~~~Easy to use and you can not only use, but even learn Tex
lyx~~~1288777586~~~yurielnf~~~5~~~The power of latex, but you can see what you are doing. I have used it for 3 years. It works on windows too.

lzop~~~1281134820~~~silver~~~5~~~Middling compression ratio, but compression speed is often real-time.  This makes lzo great for shuffling around gobs of data, for when compression status is unknown, for data known to compress easily and well, etc.

mc~~~1273957924~~~jkw~~~4~~~Use it over shell to a linux server and sometimes on my desktop to manage files. But I still miss good old Total Commander from time as a Windows User. Sure, there's gnome-commander and such, but they are far behind in functionallity.
mc~~~1274113612~~~vadi01~~~5~~~yea like total commander but less graphical. Ever since i began to use linux i put it in my 'must to have applications' list. Makes it easier to copy, delete, make files and directories from one place to another and link up to ftp servers.
mc~~~1274370738~~~awilliams~~~5~~~A must-have Norton Commander clone... takes me back to the old days of DOS

mc~~~1282243862~~~Rafson~~~5~~~very useful

mc~~~1299795240~~~wanda~~~4~~~Best konsole file manager yep.
mc~~~1300932287~~~miana~~~1~~~MC doesn't show up in my laptop, and I cannot find MC anywhere in my laptop. It doesn't show up after I restarted laptop either. So I think this app is useless.

mc~~~1314113135~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~good tool
mc~~~1311524786~~~bugz~~~5~~~I used to use that to manage my FreeBSD server as well as linux desktops. Not really anymore (using nautilus, gnome-do and console),  but if you need to manage file structures or had a habit to use FAR manager in Win before this would be great app for you.

mediatomb~~~1295049692~~~morbieus~~~5~~~Bought a new LG Netcast LCD TV. Only came with windows software to serve media files. No luck with the Nero Mediahome software under Virtualbox so went lookiong for Linux software and found this easy to use Mediatomb. The web interface makes selecting media folders easy. I have connected the TV via Ethernet cable.
mediatomb~~~1299926154~~~l1dge~~~5~~~Great piece of software. Works fabulousy, replace twonkymedia with this.
mediatomb~~~1316382584~~~xrdeem~~~3~~~Needs a GUI badly. As a noob and coming from Windows this is priority #1, and I'm sure someone with a bit of coding experience could get one up and running in a few hours if they tried. Had to search for hours on google for a step by step tutorial on installing it. After editing the config.xml file by typing sudo gedit /etc/mediatomb/config.xml and replacing "no" with "yes" in <server> <enable ui="no" ...> you have to do a sudo /etc/init.d/mediatomb restart in terminal. Only then will the MediaTomb admin page finally show up.
mediatomb~~~1318496209~~~djnes69~~~4~~~Es de lo poco bueno que hay en linux para el tema DLNA. Un aplauso para los desarrolladores. Seguid así.
medit~~~1270927873~~~Roin~~~5~~~Great editor, it became my standard editor for text editing and simple coding stuff-

mednafen~~~1275025096~~~jmac~~~4~~~I've used with gameboy advanced roms, works well. Key mapping works but is slightly inconvenient.
mednafen~~~1310293097~~~angelcleff~~~5~~~Works pretty well!, i like it but if only had a GUI it would be simply the best.
mednafen~~~1312386864~~~blueXrider~~~3~~~Emulator
mednafen~~~1313549046~~~lctrgk~~~5~~~El mejor emulador que he visto para estos sistemas en linux.
meld~~~1271586245~~~distrohopper~~~5~~~I use it for manually patching files. Very helpful.
meld~~~1272476404~~~Alexio~~~4~~~Check diffs on files, from code to text files. Features colored output and editing/merging/cut on the fly.
meld~~~1275537519~~~opticyclic~~~4~~~Nice diff on files and directories. Merge isn't quite as good as Diffuse though.

mercurial~~~1316660160~~~notyourbuddy~~~5~~~Being new to Linux and coming from Window's Subversion Tortoise I thought I might run into trouble... but this versioning system is so easy to setup and use that I don't even bother grabbing a GUI frontend for it.  Checking out, commits, branches, and merges etc are such a breeze. Love it so much I even ditched Subversion in favor of Mercurial + command prompt when I need to work from a Windows machine!

metacity~~~1270989514~~~Roin~~~2~~~I never understood why GNOME uses such a weak Window Manager.
metacity~~~1314125053~~~chumney_2000~~~5~~~Compiz lagged really bad on my quadcore with hd3200 gpu. I fixed it but it broke most of my system time to time. And i lost my workspaces, something i have been spoiled with when getting used to linux and android. Untill Compiz fixes this, I will stick to metacity. I am NOT the only one with the same problem. Thank you metacity for giving me a stable window manager, while letting me keep the extra features like workspaces I've come to enjoy. 5 stars, the lagging was really annoying and for a minute I ALMOST went back to windows 7. Metacity to the rescue!

micropolis~~~1281159568~~~Xyie~~~4~~~This feels like a blast from the past, an open sourced version of SimCity, which I used to play a long time ago, only now I have half an idea what I'm doing while playing with it. It's got some funny quirks here and there, but they don't interfere with the game.
micropolis~~~1290115254~~~H4x0r18~~~5~~~Great clone of the classic SimyCity game! Love it.
midori~~~1268007251~~~conquerortim~~~4~~~Good lightweight fast web browser, but currently missing some features (like remembering passwords).
midori~~~1269499011~~~relst~~~4~~~Use it often over X-forwarded SSH. Is nice and light. Just like arora.
midori~~~1269986361~~~rekkid~~~4~~~It handles flash videos better than any other browser
midori~~~1270468816~~~clem~~~3~~~Good browser
midori~~~1271318447~~~peramak~~~4~~~good and light
midori~~~1272781775~~~Grundoko~~~5~~~Gets a perfect score on the Acid Test 3, perfroms faster than any other browser I've used, has a simple but nice looking interface, and loads very quickly.
midori~~~1274221552~~~Mitzh~~~3~~~lack of functionality, but light
midori~~~1274763347~~~ddalley~~~1~~~Browsers must be able to display all pages and perform all functions on the page. Midori can't live up to that. If you can't access message editors on a forum, you're in trouble. This one needs more work.
midori~~~1274781116~~~huntman~~~4~~~it is OK
midori~~~1274933787~~~spayk~~~4~~~Great for low spec computers
midori~~~1275016143~~~thx1138~~~4~~~Fast and stable. Not that much functionality as FF, but as good as Chromium.
midori~~~1276923946~~~khai~~~2~~~Needs a LOT of developement to become a full & usable browser
midori~~~1277026145~~~thebrix~~~3~~~Very fast but basics need work - for example,
midori~~~1277376344~~~majortws~~~4~~~good but gmail only worked in basic html. Need work.
midori~~~1304893547~~~Xyie~~~3~~~A simple browser that's easy to use. Streamlined interface, works like Opera, feels like Firefox, light like Chromium. A bit unstable at times for now, however. must disable extentions and features to keep it from crashing.
midori~~~1279916816~~~robertofmj~~~5~~~Great browser. Includes mouse gestures, keyboard shortcuts and many features. More lightweight than chromium.
midori~~~1280058600~~~turin13~~~3~~~Lightweight, but lacks some important futures, like password manager. Anyway, app worth trying.
midori~~~1283523637~~~JumaX9~~~5~~~Great!
midori~~~1286733509~~~patriki~~~4~~~Simple web browser. Enough features but lack of password manager and a better bookmarks manager... Fast.

midori~~~1293750435~~~RobinJ~~~4~~~Hmm... Nice homepage xD Error - file:///usr/share/ubuntu-artwork/home/index.html || It's a fine webbrowser, only things I miss is Java support (doesn't work for some reason...) and the CTRL+Enter thingy most browsers have (type in youtube, press CTRL+Enter, and it becomes youtube.com).
midori~~~1294847620~~~wanda~~~5~~~Fur mein Netbook klein , schnell und leicht dus ausgezeichnet.
midori~~~1294936165~~~grim~~~2~~~Lightweight, but keeps crashing :\
midori~~~1295105800~~~guv999~~~3~~~great potential in the future, not quite there yet.  Not straight forward to imprt bookmarks from other browsers for instance
midori~~~1296263337~~~eliofernandes~~~3~~~at list work very good on youtube videos
midori~~~1296398891~~~Koffeehaus~~~5~~~Excellent minimalistic touch. However for some reason I get the impression that Chromium is a bit faster. Am going to try it out and see how it flows on the long run. Default homepage isn't working as it is set for Ubuntu, not Mint. As for Ctl + Enter (see below), it has no use for European users, as it supports only .com domains; and not .co.uk for example.
midori~~~1296703336~~~Daiko~~~2~~~this browser is still in its infancy (version 0.2.8-1) and appears to be able to grow into something wonderful, but as of now is still immature and lacks the "Straightforward bookmark management" that is mentioned in the features list (which was disappointing). I prefer Chromium for its ease of use, powerful features and minimalistic style & design- I'll be removing Midori tonight and try other browsers in the meantime. I will give this browser a retake later on after it grows more though.

minitube~~~1267656443~~~clem~~~5~~~This app is fantastic! Plays cartoons for the kids, plays music for me, finds games reviews... it's like TV on-demand :)
minitube~~~1270429928~~~omkar~~~1~~~the videos simply did not get loaded in the application, although the fresh listing is visible
minitube~~~1271081630~~~KittyKatt~~~5~~~This is awesome. No need to go to YouTube anymore. :D
minitube~~~1271364402~~~Teucca~~~5~~~YouTube in one place!
minitube~~~1271812457~~~maty1206~~~3~~~The ideology is very good, but the application is not awesome like suppose to be. It is like a Youtube for touch screen.
minitube~~~1273208096~~~VICTOR360~~~5~~~This app is Great Faster Thant The Normal Youtube!
minitube~~~1273722508~~~scoon1329~~~4~~~Good, but the dependencies are incomplete, don't forget to sudo apt-get install phonon-backend-gstreamer gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
minitube~~~1273876991~~~caje~~~4~~~Light and fast but I need login option, favourites, own playlists, etc.

minitube~~~1274808353~~~kip-~~~5~~~greate one!
minitube~~~1275526111~~~SeanBest~~~5~~~Wicked cool idea. Needs work, but the author updates the site regularly and listens to his users.
minitube~~~1275927282~~~pbmuk~~~4~~~Nice simple player. Playlist window is a bit big. Needs phonon-backend-gstreamer which is available via the Software Manager
minitube~~~1276088228~~~manuele11~~~4~~~useful
minitube~~~1276260285~~~Crankster~~~1~~~Looks cool but its not working in Linux Mint 9.  There is a list of videos but they do not play.
minitube~~~1276727668~~~castor91~~~4~~~Ottimo, non necessita di un browser ed è facile da usare.. necessita del pacchetto phonon-backend-gstreamer per funzionare
minitube~~~1276793202~~~5_O_Clock_Charlie~~~5~~~Worked perfectly !! Used half the CPU resources as playing the same video on Youtube.
minitube~~~1277043266~~~asymmetros~~~5~~~working perfectly in isadora! its speed is unbelievable. I do like also the layout, no comments blalbla, its you and the videos. In fact, i feel that i 'm watching a dvd, not a video through internet..
minitube~~~1277068042~~~abvflux~~~2~~~This too does not work for me in Isadora. However, this could be great if functional.
minitube~~~1298785537~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Ok, before complaining that it doesn't work at all, remember: to make it work on Mint 10, you MUST add the phonon-backend-gstreamer package. They really need to correct its dependencies!
minitube~~~1277386221~~~genoskill~~~3~~~I Installed every libgdata I found and a library called libxine1-ffmpeg. Then it worked. Anyway, I love the apearance of this program.
minitube~~~1286856217~~~dangger~~~3~~~Needs libxine1-ffmpeg to play videos.

minitube~~~1291310639~~~sabinandrei~~~5~~~on julia x64 i had to install libxine1-ffmpeg to make it work
minitube~~~1290348433~~~goly~~~3~~~It was nice (but not necessary) until it worked :) Some days after the installation videos were found but not played. I don't know why it suddenly stopped working but I solved by installing libxine1-ffmpeg (as proposed by dangger)

mint-artwork-gnome~~~1293471830~~~Shostako~~~5~~~Nice and well suited artwork, one of the beasts in Linux distro world.
mint-artwork-gnome~~~1293748851~~~RobinJ~~~4~~~Nice... But it's a bit clumsy that the wallpapers of Linux Mint 9 (the ones which clearly show the number 9) have been left in.
mint-artwork-gnome~~~1307264918~~~RavS~~~4~~~Good, but can be better. I want better Mint!

mint-dropbox~~~1282138328~~~niks~~~5~~~WHAT have you Mintys done to it ??? I use the nautilus version and not this one for that reason please fix it other wise it's great There are no icons showing changes or notifications ??????? I uninstalled and used the The easy way to pass things around without all the hasstle of uploading and downloading, or even logging in. Whether your moving your files around your own PC / netbook / PDA /  Phone or exchanging those photo's or  videos with the family or friends who still haven't moved to Mint or got a Mac from work. I even sync my Tomboy notes with it so all my notes get shared to all my PC's.
mint-dropbox~~~1275016289~~~grhdtj~~~5~~~Previously I used an sshfs but it didnot support web UI and online backup. Also, it was not well supported on Windows. I like this mint-dropbox very much. This is much better. Thank Mint and this software scores because I became to know this dropbox thanks to them.
mint-dropbox~~~1275098331~~~SeventhReign~~~5~~~The best available, hands down.

mint-dropbox~~~1275242346~~~huntman~~~5~~~Very useful
mint-dropbox~~~1275369245~~~Tasyo~~~5~~~The Mintified version doesn't work for me even on a clean install.  It keeps reinstalling after a reboot.  However, the version from the dropbox website will work if you find yourself in the same predicament as I had.
mint-dropbox~~~1275703588~~~superstargoddess~~~5~~~Best system of this type!
mint-dropbox~~~1275837174~~~Jinryu~~~5~~~Very convenient.  For less than awesome conncetions, it really chokes the connection though-- generally, I take it out of my startup applications and periodically just click-to-load so that it syncs everything at once, since I don't need constant syncing.  This way, I can just take everything when I know that some of my peers have loaded fies up.
mint-dropbox~~~1276386773~~~svalbard~~~5~~~Dropbox is excellent, but I also had trouble getting this version to work. You may be best off using the .deb on the Dropbox website.
mint-dropbox~~~1276554541~~~thx1138~~~2~~~Mmint-dropbox works on 50% of all MintMachines i installed it on. Nautilus-dropbox works on EVERY machine. So go to dropbox.com and download it from there.

mintbackup~~~1273779831~~~linuxmint~~~5~~~This is a great tool for Linux Mint. My windows machine can't do these simple things.
mintbackup~~~1275578181~~~mcduarte2000~~~3~~~I love the software selection backup. But for backing up the home directory, Déjà Dup gives more options.
mintbackup~~~1288559175~~~wanda~~~2~~~Habe es gebraucht .. sorry nein danke.
mintbackup~~~1282411294~~~incogita~~~2~~~The simple interface is great, however, it lacks the ability to do scheduled or automatic backups, nor can you use it to backup to an internet location.
mintbackup~~~1291726289~~~crom~~~5~~~Just what I needed.
mintbackup~~~1292195159~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~Although this is a very good tool, it still needs some serious polishing. Sure, it would be awesome if you could schedule file backups, database exports or even allow remote management, simpler things would also be welcome. Backing up the home folder is cool but with so many hidden folder it would be nice if we could have multiple options wheter we want to restore/ignore the hidden folders and based on that option to specify the exception(s). This two-step feature for hidden folders would make it much easier to backup/restore exactly what is needed. The main issue with restoring bulk hidden folders is replacing newly installed files with old settings when the user doesn't want that. Anyway, I'll eagerly wait newer version of this tool. :)
mintbackup~~~1292563492~~~tomdiana~~~4~~~good home directory backup program.
mintbackup~~~1293749006~~~RobinJ~~~5~~~Finally a back-up program that does what's it supposed to do, nothing more or less! The only thing I miss is a function to synchronize with your back-ups.
mintbackup~~~1302388590~~~guv999~~~3~~~Easy to use, but can take a long time if you have significant amounts of data.   Also would be good if it could be synced and could make incremental back ups
mintbackup~~~1299977142~~~Rockzalo~~~4~~~Cumple, pero seria mas completo si los respaldos fueran automaticos y programables
mintbackup~~~1304602341~~~sayan_acharjee~~~3~~~nice tool.
mintbackup~~~1311589211~~~nima_rahbar~~~5~~~Great Backup app with Application Selection

mintbackup~~~1314617861~~~tecknomage~~~4~~~Use to backup to USB Stick
mintbackup~~~1317761328~~~Anleoje~~~5~~~Excelente para cuando necesitamos hacer una reinstalación o sufrimos de pérdidas de datos o de software ;)
mintbackup~~~1320186688~~~chassum~~~3~~~Love the simple interface and the option to backup software. But I can't really use it until it allows backups to network drives
mintbackup~~~1321821165~~~Tonya~~~5~~~As a "Home directory backup tool" works perfectly.
mintconstructor~~~1275791902~~~linuxmint~~~5~~~Absoultely Brilliant! The tool is very easy to use and get used to. It's better than any other tool to make a live cd in my opinion.
mintconstructor~~~1295740049~~~grim~~~4~~~Very useful!
mintdesktop~~~1293749277~~~RobinJ~~~5~~~Great! But maybe it would be good to embed it into the Appearance diolog.

mintdesktop~~~1312243690~~~blueXrider~~~3~~~good
mintinstall~~~1273419080~~~timmi~~~1~~~Pretty but not practical. SLOW (long pauses, especially on startup). Hard to guess what category they want you to look in for an app and it's not evident what category it would be found under.
mintinstall~~~1273544703~~~linuxmint~~~4~~~Easy GUI to install apps. Simple, but effective.
mintinstall~~~1274043483~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~The new mintinstall in Linux Mint 9 is very nice. It got to be so easy to use I had the feeling I should open a terminal and install my software with apt-get just to have the feeling it's done. Kind of funny, but it really is very easy. Still, there's room for improvement so I gave it four stars. :)
mintinstall~~~1275370382~~~eurobusker~~~1~~~it doesnt work
mintinstall~~~1275803704~~~nivapo~~~3~~~???????? ????????????? ?????????, ? ??????????? ???????????. ?? ???? ????????? ????. ????????, ???????? ??????????? ????????? ? ??????? ????????.
mintinstall~~~1276353188~~~Hromin~~~3~~~It is not comfortably and not elegantly. The previous version was much more successful. Why not develop a MintInstall v.6? It's the same regression!
mintinstall~~~1276361283~~~Sherbet~~~4~~~I much prefer the structure of Lenny's Synaptic.  When searching it can hang up as you're typing the search word.  But for Isadora, I like MintInstall better than Synaptic.
mintinstall~~~1278406635~~~spayk~~~2~~~Long pauses when searching and application names look like they do in Synaptic, making searching tricky.
mintinstall~~~1278428539~~~crom~~~3~~~Good for searching apps and reading opinions but bad for installing anything. It should tell me which packages exactly are going to be installed.
mintinstall~~~1278603217~~~guru~~~3~~~submit review, incorrect display of utf-8 characters,
mintinstall~~~1279251497~~~Fuzzi99~~~3~~~pretty and slightly informative but not very practical
mintinstall~~~1279454017~~~srini2174~~~4~~~It is very good.  There is no information on whether the pre-requisite softwares are installed or not.  Further when there is an error in the installation there is no feedback given to the user about the failure
mintinstall~~~1280009949~~~lewah~~~5~~~Revolutionary ! Linux becomes a real install and go platform. Nice for electing user prefered software.
mintinstall~~~1283004471~~~winnerer~~~2~~~Doesnt work well, doesn`t install apps now
mintinstall~~~1283005726~~~ivanovnegro~~~4~~~Good program but with some minor problems.
mintinstall~~~1286924068~~~frankeinstein~~~4~~~Nice program easy to use good way to find what you need, Interface could be a little prettier when compared to others but on the whole another piece of Mint magic.
mintinstall~~~1287036317~~~tmfk626~~~5~~~Big improvement over 8, and easier to manage than the package mgr.
mintinstall~~~1290901997~~~romanybob~~~3~~~Simple, which is ok. But limited, and a little clanky.
mintinstall~~~1290970176~~~m4daredsun~~~3~~~Simple app with very nice search capabilities. However, mintinstall provides only little information during/after software install, which is quite bad
mintinstall~~~1290971538~~~ezecool~~~5~~~es lo mas, lo mejor que me pudo pasar en linux
mintinstall~~~1293325539~~~Shostako~~~4~~~If Syanptic is very difficult or boring for you, and you don't like the community web, this is the best solution for install software. Easy, simple to use, and not ugly.
mintinstall~~~1293637412~~~dagon~~~2~~~I don't trust it really and it lacks functions. It misses to show parcels that are there, the controlls are nonintuitive and it only shows screenshots for some 300 packages even though there are catalogs with screenshots online to link to.
mintinstall~~~1293748923~~~RobinJ~~~5~~~In Linux Mint 8 it was a real mess. But the developers managed do do a really good job on it, congratulations to them!
mintinstall~~~1294176720~~~Penumbra~~~2~~~The reviews feature is only reson-d'etre of this app. Synaptic is easier and faster.
mintinstall~~~1294608944~~~liquidblock~~~5~~~i like it

mintinstall~~~1299335915~~~wanda~~~3~~~Synaptic.
mintinstall~~~1299577809~~~changsijay~~~5~~~good, but chinese can not display normal on comments
mintinstall~~~1302090090~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~very nice to install software, can also be added later to install, but no information if there is one software that removed/conflict, also details how many kb or mb which downloaded.
mintinstall~~~1304633607~~~Tonya~~~5~~~Use both Mintinstall and Synaptic. Mintinstall is very nice.
mintinstall~~~1304636066~~~mikefreeman~~~5~~~While Synaptic offers more control, it can be overwhelming if you're just browsing. MintInstall is great when you just want to either quickly install/uninstall something, or browse around for something new.
mintinstall~~~1304754180~~~mjoens41~~~5~~~love the fact you can rate things!
mintinstall~~~1305146169~~~Germmare~~~4~~~useful
mintinstall~~~1305516921~~~FroyoShark~~~5~~~It's great, not as good as the Ubuntu one, but you can rate things, and the one in Katya is much better than in Julia.
mintinstall~~~1306572425~~~Dannie~~~5~~~Works great and it has really awesome features.
mintinstall~~~1309015280~~~Kuchum~~~3~~~???? - ???????, ?? ????????? ???????? ?? ????????

mintinstall~~~1309529420~~~thor480~~~3~~~Hade that you have to use code, alway on it. Fix it
mintinstall~~~1310421605~~~tamoghna4~~~4~~~like it, but i use synaptic more
mintinstall~~~1310437746~~~SeventhReign~~~5~~~Better than Synaptic
mintinstall~~~1310914524~~~kephalian~~~3~~~Stops working if you change the repositories.
mintinstall~~~1311940830~~~RavS~~~4~~~Quite good but can get better. Use it more often than Synaptic.
mintinstall~~~1317760684~~~Anleoje~~~3~~~Aún le falta camino por recorrer, el Ubuntu Software Center es bastante más avanzado en comparación a mintinstall ;)
mintinstall~~~1319087673~~~wtlhk~~~1~~~GUI looks old fashioned compared with ubuntu
mintinstall~~~1320780929~~~Formatado~~~2~~~It's very slow to install something, I use synaptic
mintmenu~~~1273544594~~~linuxmint~~~5~~~Best menu I've ever seen. Attractive, Unique, and advanced all into a small package.
mintmenu~~~1274286760~~~zroo3d~~~5~~~extreme ergonomic, eye candy main menu
mintmenu~~~1274801227~~~farnaby~~~5~~~This already is enough reason to love LinuxMint.
mintmenu~~~1274801227~~~farnaby~~~5~~~This already is enough reason to love LinuxMint.
mintmenu~~~1274933441~~~spayk~~~5~~~Excellent, one of mint's best features
mintmenu~~~1275060740~~~mintymintminty~~~5~~~One Of Many Of Linux Mints Best Feature's
mintmenu~~~1275061191~~~nikhilsinha~~~5~~~This is the Mint's best feature. No other OS has it.
mintmenu~~~1275162755~~~haruspexed~~~4~~~good menu, personally using it in lucid, but needs design and usability rework, looks dated
mintmenu~~~1307383272~~~count_negative~~~5~~~The best menu I've ever seen
mintmenu~~~1275777056~~~Az4x4~~~3~~~Good idea but the menu needs a serious facelift. Looks very dated.
mintmenu~~~1277223311~~~Lopau~~~5~~~Just love it!
mintmenu~~~1307384653~~~wanda~~~4~~~Haubt menu besser fuer mich doch.
mintmenu~~~1278027163~~~funker2010~~~5~~~I love it! i think its better than the kde and gnome menues
mintmenu~~~1278454175~~~zalesthebard~~~5~~~really powerful
mintmenu~~~1278540708~~~Xyie~~~5~~~I found I missed this on Ubuntu. The configuration could be even better, but with each release it seems to improve.
mintmenu~~~1279207266~~~Wamukota~~~5~~~Stil one the best menu around
mintmenu~~~1279210413~~~mikefreeman~~~3~~~Not bad as these things go, but not my favorite menu. Theme doesn't match the default system theme at all - which gave me a bad first impression. A little awkward to use. A bit too Windows-like (I came from Mac, so don't like the Windows one-button-menu-on-the-bottom scheme, but can appreciate this menu's target audience). Have to move the mouse too far from the menu button to get to the applications, and I don't want ALL the apps I use clogging up the favorites list. I personally prefer the normal Ubuntu-like menu bar applet better. Good thing Linux Mint has so many options!
mintmenu~~~1279214175~~~pbmuk~~~4~~~Very nice menu and improved in Isadora. I would like more control over the options though: Favourites should have a 1 line entry setting and allow you to change the text for apps
mintmenu~~~1279250882~~~Fuzzi99~~~5~~~the best menu ever (althoutgh KDE's menu comes close)
mintmenu~~~1279312229~~~dckjnsn~~~5~~~good stuff  kde is ok too, but this allows for more personalization
mintmenu~~~1279898094~~~ivanovnegro~~~4~~~Very good menu, a mix of the kde menu and the simplicity of gnome.
mintmenu~~~1279996001~~~asymmetros~~~5~~~I love this menu. Very functional and you can customize it in various ways.
mintmenu~~~1280009823~~~lewah~~~5~~~Un bond en avant pour Gnome et par rapport à Ubuntu
mintmenu~~~1280623222~~~brianji03~~~4~~~Very efficient menu. it would be nice if it loaded up right away though like a main menu should.
mintmenu~~~1281728792~~~Jac978~~~5~~~A big big thank you for this app!
mintmenu~~~1282311219~~~flor_de_azucena~~~5~~~Unique in its efficiency.
mintmenu~~~1282464919~~~Jinryu~~~5~~~Probably one of the BEST innovations in the 'menu' ever.

mintmenu~~~1284854701~~~emuse~~~5~~~Good, Great, Grand! Although I do wish the filter had an option to search files and content within files as win7 and mac. BUT.. it is the best yet in linux.
mintmenu~~~1285370790~~~anguyita~~~5~~~impresionante
mintmenu~~~1286913385~~~frankeinstein~~~5~~~Mintmenu is quite simply the best menu for Gnome bar none.

mintmenu~~~1291819722~~~sskeller~~~5~~~best menu I've ever used
mintmenu~~~1292193855~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~I love MintMenu! But I'm not willing to give it 5 stars just yet simply because of the scrolling issue I keep having since years now. Dragging the scroll bar with the mouse won't work if you get out of the scroll area, which make it a bit difficult to scroll by mouse if you don't have a wheel or if it doesn't work (properly). But I do recommend this menu to anyone. I wish we had it in KDE, XFCE, LXDE and Fluxbox as well. It's really that good, plus it constantly gets improved. :) Thank you, Mint developers!.
mintmenu~~~1292372418~~~Shostako~~~5~~~Nice and useful menu, one of the best I ever seen in a Gnome system
mintmenu~~~1292650241~~~binarypokey~~~3~~~vnice
mintmenu~~~1292678239~~~apolczer~~~4~~~nice

mintmenu~~~1307964057~~~trollboy~~~5~~~I'm not normally a fan of these "extended" menus, but this one is slick and simple. It is definitely a selling point for Mint.

mintmenu~~~1311202572~~~peyotll~~~4~~~better than original gnome menu
mintmenu~~~1311524079~~~bugz~~~5~~~Well done. Beautiful menu if you need to things `old-way`, but I prefer to use gnome-do as fastest way to tell computer what to do.
mintmenu~~~1312271350~~~linuxali~~~4~~~very well it like suse menu
mintmenu~~~1313761248~~~Labby~~~5~~~It looks good and it works...enough said.
mintmenu~~~1314617637~~~tecknomage~~~5~~~This one feature that sold me on Mint 10
mintmenu~~~1315230885~~~ralfreddin~~~5~~~mint is great!
mintmenu~~~1315262678~~~bodam~~~4~~~Looks good.  Is a good transition for Windows users.
mintmenu~~~1315779099~~~Rufus~~~5~~~One of the main reasons for using Linux Mint. Not only for people who come from the Windows world. Even for former Mac users.
mintmenu~~~1317000783~~~Anleoje~~~5~~~I love it!!! :D
mintmenu~~~1317221247~~~Hil002~~~5~~~Intuitivo

mintmenu~~~1319087440~~~wtlhk~~~2~~~Works fine, but we cannot customize the color of the text/background and it does not suit my current dark theme, just removed and use the ubuntu menu
mintmenu~~~1319478255~~~Adidi~~~5~~~I hope to find a command to show mintmenu with cairo-dock... :-)
mintmenu~~~1319563732~~~krause~~~4~~~Simples e funcional
mintnanny~~~1273779906~~~linuxmint~~~5~~~Awesome GUI for managing the hosts file. Great for newbies.
mintnanny~~~1290029359~~~wanda~~~3~~~Niemahls gebraucht.
mintnanny~~~1292087186~~~nicu96~~~5~~~sehr gut, aber das bräuchte man eher für windows (schonmal kinder gesehen die mit linux arbeiten?)
mintnanny~~~1293293221~~~guismo~~~4~~~very good as a default, but could get more options
mintnanny~~~1293749099~~~RobinJ~~~1~~~It doesn't work...
mintnanny~~~1295024517~~~dagon~~~4~~~It works well. ( you need to restart firefox after adding domains )
mintnanny~~~1295740092~~~grim~~~4~~~Just works!
mintnanny~~~1302383484~~~Germmare~~~3~~~what for ? ...
mintnanny~~~1311941043~~~RavS~~~4~~~Quite good. Works when u want to stop some sites from opening. And others can have a hard time finding out why it refuses to open!
mintupdate~~~1273544504~~~linuxmint~~~5~~~Good utility for updating your operating system and programs. Fast and easy to manage. Lots of great features.
mintupdate~~~1276128813~~~SeanBest~~~4~~~Easy way to update, some nice configuration

mintupdate~~~1279207334~~~Wamukota~~~5~~~Simple, stable and the icons are much improved in Mint9
mintupdate~~~1279251053~~~Fuzzi99~~~4~~~nicest update app I've ever used (but Apple Software Update comes very close)
mintupdate~~~1279312534~~~dckjnsn~~~5~~~point 'n click...just the way i likes it.
mintupdate~~~1280147611~~~ivanovnegro~~~5~~~Great! All updates with one click.
mintupdate~~~1280530643~~~Celtore~~~5~~~Very nice, and incredibly organized. I love the software update teirs, and how you can choose to enable or disable certain areas to be updated. It is simple, automatic, and very nicely implimented
mintupdate~~~1281337789~~~elscripto~~~4~~~Very good visual tool. However I would like to see two additional functionalities to it, if possible: 1. Point-and-click way to move new upgrade package proposals from the main screen to 'Ignored packages', probably smth like 'Ignore selected'; 2. Notifications for upgrade failure of packages, when dependancies exist at 'Ignore packages'.
mintupdate~~~1281577634~~~thx1138~~~5~~~Das beste und benutzerfreundlichste Programm, das dein Mint durch die Voreinstellungen stabil hält. Individuelle Einstellungen sind schnell mit ein paar Klicks erledigt, ohne das Terminal bemühen zu müssen.
mintupdate~~~1284332955~~~MathiusQuest~~~5~~~Awesome! Nothing more to say
mintupdate~~~1284954929~~~Xyie~~~5~~~One of the absolute best features of Mint. I positively love the way updates are done.
mintupdate~~~1285474621~~~French~~~5~~~The best and most user-friendly program which holds your Mint by the pre-settings stable.
mintupdate~~~1285969527~~~ceptor~~~5~~~einfach bedienbar und sehr effektiv.
mintupdate~~~1286587742~~~pilot824~~~5~~~Obviously the best lol
mintupdate~~~1286918848~~~frankeinstein~~~5~~~Super easy to use and configure. Clear listing of importance and description of each update.
mintupdate~~~1287488825~~~jesica~~~5~~~one word....awesome
mintupdate~~~1289507320~~~tristan~~~5~~~This is the best update manager I have seen.
mintupdate~~~1290355192~~~KazuSpara~~~5~~~Intelligible indication for beginners and economize time for old hands. The best manager ever.

mintupdate~~~1290613518~~~Adidi~~~4~~~Great, will it be possible to let user change level for some package? And auto update for level 1 & 2?
mintupdate~~~1291145752~~~wanda~~~3~~~so so gibt nicht immer richtig an ,obwohl updates vorhanden sind
mintupdate~~~1291145705~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Good
mintupdate~~~1291819756~~~sskeller~~~4~~~solid updater but not sure it provides much that the ubuntu updater doesn't
mintupdate~~~1292716147~~~Shostako~~~4~~~Good updater
mintupdate~~~1293749748~~~RobinJ~~~4~~~Way better than the annoying update manager Ubuntu uses!
mintupdate~~~1294546981~~~grim~~~4~~~Great!

mintupdate~~~1295737190~~~pancaran~~~4~~~Update process is easy

mintupdate~~~1303211125~~~Jac978~~~5~~~Thanks a lot for this app Mint-team!
mintupdate~~~1296878902~~~ChirmiPlay~~~5~~~Buenísimo. Me gusta lo de los niveles, no me acuerdo en qué otra distro lo había visto. Creo que en el Proyecto Fedora.
mintupdate~~~1297217381~~~cmaew04~~~5~~~Love it. Simple to use. I wish Windows would let you update quickly and not have to restart every single time I perform an update. Linux does not have that problem.
mintupdate~~~1298161770~~~sonic4spuds~~~5~~~Clean and easy to use!!
mintupdate~~~1298357343~~~orionthehunter~~~4~~~It's great, BUT I really think that change logs for non-mint software need to be incorporated as well.
mintupdate~~~1298848565~~~Mitzh~~~5~~~exelent, does the job without disturbing me
mintupdate~~~1300626664~~~Tonya~~~5~~~Easy, quick and safe!

mintupdate~~~1310102251~~~kazztan0325~~~5~~~I love it show us the Level of packages
mintupdate~~~1311524345~~~bugz~~~5~~~I can't think how to make it better, it's a pleasure even to WATCH how this app is improving your system package by package.
mintupdate~~~1311940655~~~RavS~~~5~~~Quite awesome! Keeps the system up to date.
mintupdate~~~1312243603~~~blueXrider~~~3~~~very good and easy
mintupdate~~~1313712325~~~jvbuxte~~~4~~~I'm newbie in Mint, but it seems me very good.
mintupdate~~~1314291483~~~Warlock~~~4~~~easy to use, only to bad i used 1 time the apt-get update/upgrade to get the new linux kernel.
mintupdate~~~1314618584~~~tecknomage~~~5~~~Mint 10 version is better than Ubuntu
mintupdate~~~1316430090~~~doctroya~~~5~~~Es fantástico! Una interfaz super-elegante, fácil configuración, con reconocimiento completo del hardware. Yo uso Julia en una Notebook PB Easy-Note W7 con 1 gB de RAM, y me funciona de maravillas. Definitivamente muy recomendable.
mintupdate~~~1317760217~~~Anleoje~~~5~~~Si, en realidad es fantástico, bastante completo y seguro para el usuario recién iniciado en Linux :)
mintupdate~~~1318134705~~~DksVertix~~~2~~~Why are Required System Tools even in such list? 0.o
mintupdate~~~1319087514~~~wtlhk~~~2~~~I see no reasons why using this instead of ubuntu-tweak/ apt-get to update
mintupdate~~~1319770202~~~krause~~~4~~~Muito bom.
mintupload~~~1279201662~~~ft-Orchard~~~3~~~The idea is good, but it does not do anything :(
mintupload~~~1282584526~~~Xyie~~~2~~~Looks like a good idea, but it doesn't seem immediately clear how to use it, or what to use it for. Some short explanation would be nice as to exactly what it does...where the files go and how you can access them later? Even if it's an outside service that defines this, a basic explanation would clear this up.
mintupload~~~1282745627~~~winnerer~~~1~~~Useless
mintupload~~~1283372233~~~Paskal_07~~~2~~~Better to add amazon, dropbox, etc support
mintupload~~~1290029508~~~wanda~~~2~~~Nein nichts fuer mich.
mintupload~~~1290071353~~~XQ55~~~1~~~Useless
mintupload~~~1293109170~~~7Voo~~~3~~~How does it work ?? xD
mintupload~~~1293111873~~~SeventhReign~~~5~~~Works great for uploading files to my ISPs hosting service.  Faster than opening filezilla etc.
mintupload~~~1293749741~~~RobinJ~~~5~~~Simple and great! Much easier than open up an FTP client everytime or even upload it with Nautilus. Maybe it would be nice to make an option to return the user the URL wehe the file is uploaded, so the user can copy it and paste it inside a chat window for instance, and it shouldn't be hard to make at all.
mintupload~~~1295740115~~~grim~~~4~~~Pretty useful, if you're into this kind of thing
mintupload~~~1301338282~~~Koffeehaus~~~2~~~I don't quite get it. I've asked around at the Mint forums and no one seems to have found a practical application for it. This is not a cloud, and looks like an embrio version of Filezilla.
mintupload~~~1301785120~~~zapa~~~2~~~i tried to use it... honestly! multiple times, couldn't succesfully use it ... i rather hate it. Use the window manager to ftp :)
mintupload~~~1308391442~~~dlugaz~~~2~~~it would be great, but ... it doesn't work.. It fails to connect with bigger files (em larger that 10kB, but it probably depends on user's bandwidth). FIX IT! :P
mintupload~~~1315143702~~~marksuci~~~5~~~Loving it
mintupload~~~1315542187~~~diogosg~~~5~~~very useful
mintupload~~~1319087843~~~wtlhk~~~1~~~never works.
mintwelcome~~~1273544659~~~linuxmint~~~3~~~It's okay to introduce people to Linux Mint. Not everyone needs it, although it can be improved even better.
mintwelcome~~~1293749494~~~RobinJ~~~4~~~It's good to get a dialog to introdue you to what's new. And the developers that a much better job on the welcome dialog than Microsoft did. Only downside is that right after Linux Mint is installed, most users haven't set up their internet connection yet. So wouldn't it be better to check if the user is connected to the internet, and if not, to view an offline version of the documentation with a notification that the information may be outdated and that the should connect to the internet and check again?
mintwelcome~~~1295025729~~~dagon~~~4~~~It looks good and is informative. When you're done with it the "off switch" is there in the middle.
mintwelcome~~~1295028020~~~romanybob~~~4~~~Good job, very informative :)

mintwelcome~~~1317761500~~~Anleoje~~~4~~~Muy bueno para los usuarios recién iniciados en el mundo Linux, sin embargo para los usuarios ya experimentados es  una herramienta poco útil, yo personalmente quito el paquete luego de instalar Linux Mint ;)

miro~~~1283973254~~~ikeluther~~~5~~~Just perfect!
miro~~~1284217877~~~heregoesmyusername~~~5~~~Incredible. I can't live wiothout it. Miro and TED are an incredible combination.
miro~~~1284295711~~~muddaebort~~~5~~~rss + video + miro = comfort
miro~~~1286569076~~~jalal~~~4~~~TORRENT, RSS, AUTO VIDEO DOWNLOADER
miro~~~1287516955~~~wanda~~~2~~~Not a fan . sorry.
miro~~~1288101007~~~Deadite81~~~4~~~A bit buggy on Linux, but it's the easiest to use podcast manager around.  The advantage it has over Gpodder is that you can set an individual downloading schedule for each feed.  It does torrents too, but I don't use it for that, so I can't comment on that functionality.  It does not support flash either, so trying to search for feeds from within Miro can be a headache.
miro~~~1290023361~~~luxy~~~2~~~Might work, but I don't like it. :-(
miro~~~1290042141~~~MrMinty~~~5~~~Best media app for Linux
miro~~~1291673517~~~rahamohebbi~~~5~~~I think its great !
miro~~~1291955959~~~daethyme~~~5~~~great program
miro~~~1291960625~~~Darrel~~~4~~~Did not give it enough time !st time around, could be a 5 once I learn more
miro~~~1293031698~~~joeplugg~~~4~~~Easy to use and my podcast choice of the ones I have tested
miro~~~1293795537~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~good
miro~~~1294216469~~~sojabob~~~5~~~First choice program for watching viedo podcasts, youtube, online TV etc. You can organize and enjoy all your media files, videos and audio as well. Youtube videos and Podcasts are downloaded to your media libary and stored on your hdd. You may keep them or get rid of them automatically after a self chosen period of time. What most people don't know: Miro also knows converting these file into common formats.// Dieses Programm ist die ersta Wahl, um YouTube Videos und Video podcatst zu schauen. Man kann auch seine gesamten Mediendateien verwalten, Videos ebenso wie Musik. YouTube Videos und Podcasts werden im Medienverzeichnis auf der HDD gespeichert und bleiben dort solange man möchte, oder werden nach einem selbst wählbaren Zeitraum automatisch entfernt. Was nicht jeder weiß: Miro kann diese Dateien auch in gängige Formate konvertieren. So werden aus YouTube Flash-Videos schnell Videos für den iPod etc.
miro~~~1295177104~~~cybertriveni~~~3~~~better to use other options than it
miro~~~1295640700~~~slipp3d~~~5~~~one of the best tools for getting podcasts or Rss feeds
miro~~~1296471967~~~farocker~~~5~~~Yep! Great !
miro~~~1297838128~~~fahadysf~~~4~~~Nice app! Helps me preload my videos for later viewing.
miro~~~1298977786~~~ExtraLeonard~~~5~~~Great app, I use it for podcast both, audio and video content, it is simple but powerfull application. Nice UI, littlebit looks like iTunes from apple but it is free for all of us. Thanks!
miro~~~1301144624~~~jasonjohnwells~~~5~~~Nice app!  Now that I'm in Japan with a regular ISP package 100 Mbs d/l & 100 Mbs u/l with no badwidth cap I can use it without 1000%+ markup on Gbs charged to my countrymen in Canada.  If you live in a country with draconian ISP bandwidth caps you have to be careful not to increase your bill with downloading vidoes with Miro.  That said it's a great project and they even have an easy way for you to setup a video website
miro~~~1301699710~~~argus~~~5~~~Best podcast cather around
miro~~~1304024718~~~alextsr~~~5~~~Best podcast app out there.
miro~~~1304231083~~~pappas772~~~5~~~Thanks a Lot!!!!!!!
miro~~~1307991865~~~a-woozy-fieldmouse~~~2~~~Version 3 has no music library functionality, and even version 4 doesn't support sorting by composer, so it's not good for classical music.
miro~~~1308641418~~~PingusDB~~~1~~~Terrible application; so far the worst in the Internet category. Not intuitive to use, terrible interface etc.
miro~~~1309368386~~~glou25~~~5~~~nicey
miro~~~1314486751~~~blueXrider~~~3~~~I quite like this but doesn't quite work with all vid/podcast feeds
miro~~~1319394184~~~cahyadwiguna~~~4~~~easy manage video channel, nice one
miro~~~1319925341~~~linuxsapien~~~2~~~Excellent concept, however this is useless is you have no private feeds.

mixxx~~~1274882290~~~huntman~~~5~~~very nice,works great
mixxx~~~1285375235~~~Charles~~~2~~~Quite simply the most unstable Linux application that I've ever come across. Completely useless and not fit to be in the repository. Has anyone ever tested this thing?
mixxx~~~1288634197~~~gbolton2008~~~4~~~not quite traktor, but nearly

mixxx~~~1309871102~~~tedr56~~~4~~~Very nice substitution to expensive proprietary solutions. Support of timecoded vinyl and cd's makes it very usefull. But the application can be perfected.
mkvtoolnix-gui~~~1267810611~~~clem~~~5~~~I use this to split mkv videos to make them fit on FAT USB sticks. The GUI isn't great but the app is working very well.
mmucl~~~1321777291~~~cirx~~~4~~~Good! Does work with Linux Mint 11. Very oldfashioned interface, fonts not perfect to the eye, nevertheless easy to use, configurable enough, with colours and history scrollback on up/down arrows.
moblin-cursor-theme~~~1284106254~~~shwany~~~5~~~its a cool theme, i like the neon effect.
moblin-icon-theme~~~1284149884~~~shwany~~~3~~~its faint, i suppose its ment for moblin anyway and not for mint!
moc~~~1278247746~~~epictetus~~~5~~~I love that it's a comprehensive music player that can be controlled using only the keyboard. I use my computer as my media player and am frequently away from my computer screen, but I have a lightweight wireless keyboard that I can use with moc to switch albums or repeat modes or seek to a better part of a song or anything without having to go back to my computer.
moc~~~1291596094~~~kopwyn~~~5~~~Best player ever!
moc~~~1296614293~~~hexram~~~4~~~Small footprint, no GUI music player
moc~~~1307282003~~~Althorion~~~5~~~Great UI, fast, doesn't require MPD. My fauvorite console music player.

mondo~~~1295518000~~~kip-~~~5~~~i was looking for this software long time

mono-complete~~~1305489892~~~trollboy~~~2~~~There is no doubting the quality of what has been produced by the Mono project but...  it's based on a Microsoft technology even if it an open standard
mono-complete~~~1305493465~~~wanda~~~1~~~no.

moonlight-plugin-mozilla~~~1291218743~~~Anubis~~~3~~~Needed to watch skynews, they sadly rely on a pointless technology (silverlight) after trying the plugin from go-mono, the stream would not play... however this package makes it work.
moonlight-plugin-mozilla~~~1292554357~~~l1qu1d~~~1~~~doesn't work with netflix
moonlight-plugin-mozilla~~~1308582963~~~Ioseph~~~3~~~Supposed to be a linux version of silverlight. (Silverlight being MS crap) This may or maynot work for your needs. Give it a try.
moovida~~~1270933609~~~Alexio~~~5~~~Excelent media center! Features an elegant and intuitive interface optimized for HDTV viewing, easily manages and plays all your local content (videos, music, photos), accesses all types of online media content (YouTube, SHOUTcast, Flickr, etc).

moovida~~~1286545007~~~zaenal1234~~~3~~~too heavy for old pc.
moovida~~~1286564415~~~intel352~~~5~~~I lean more towards the interface found in XBMC (xbmc.org), but this application works flawlessly for me, while XBMC had video display issues.
moovida~~~1287173894~~~dazw2000~~~4~~~Well designed media center,could do with a few tweaks for setting up the directorys to find music and so forth.also not being able to play any video items from the web.

moovida~~~1304626624~~~Aralk~~~4~~~Really great but a pity only version 1.09 is in the repository. I hope v2.1 will be included in Mint 11 as this version is awesome
moovida~~~1306026691~~~wanako~~~2~~~Too demanding on resources.

mountmanager~~~1274919506~~~jjcobm~~~5~~~Best partition and FSTAB editor hands down!
mountmanager~~~1279313572~~~dckjnsn~~~3~~~DONT USE IF U DANT UNDERSTAND!!!!  i had to reinstall after mucking things up.
mountmanager~~~1280446531~~~Eun-Hjzjined~~~2~~~Tried this on lm9 and it borked mounting for all users save root. Not recommmended.
mountmanager~~~1281726022~~~therock~~~5~~~nice program
mountmanager~~~1290806833~~~Deadite81~~~3~~~Not bad, but you really need to understand what you're doing to use this, which sorta defeats the purpose.
mountmanager~~~1295118034~~~moigagoo~~~4~~~Saves me tons of time and nerve
mountpy~~~1288531136~~~duraiyuvaraj~~~5~~~New user must have.  Searching my DVD drvie took two days. it solved my issue. thank you the contributor.
mousepad~~~1271812034~~~maty1206~~~4~~~It's GUI is just like leafpad, but it is improved the printing support. Good but a little bit heavy.
mousepad~~~1275158779~~~AndrewX192~~~3~~~Very basic text editor, not for programmers or web designers. If you want more features go for kate/kwrite or gedit.
mousepad~~~1279069935~~~dumpstar123~~~5~~~Good STUFF!!!!
mousepad~~~1280588723~~~jelevin~~~4~~~preferred to leafpad
mousepad~~~1284742488~~~mjjzf~~~2~~~This as an editor is more like the infamous Notepad than something you can use for development and design. The lack of syntax highlighting makes it uninteresting to me compared to other applications more potent but still lightweight - like Medit and Beaver.
mousepad~~~1288477992~~~Xyie~~~5~~~There's not a lot to this, and for me, that's a plus. Sometimes I need a quick place to type something up where Notes/Tomboy doesn't make sense or doesn't have enough space, and where a word processing program is just too slow or too much. This isn't really oriented towards being any sort of IDE at all, though it does have line numbers if you need it for a light purpose of doing some code work. Fast, quick, simple, and works like a charm.
mousepad~~~1297137793~~~flan_suse~~~3~~~Leafpad is better. Old and even new versions of Mousepad still have some annoying bugs.
mousepad~~~1298600102~~~zc456~~~4~~~Really like Mousepad. Very simple and reminds me of Notepad - in a good way. I mostly develop using an IDE, so having this does not bother me.
mousepad~~~1301565380~~~farnaby~~~4~~~Nothing special, but works as expected.
mousepad~~~1311065931~~~altayanta~~~5~~~Very fast to open TXT and CVS format files. Now is my default TXT viewer!
mousepad~~~1314358161~~~trollboy~~~4~~~Nice editor. Simple and fast. I prefer this to gedit when using a GUI.
mozilla-openoffice.org~~~1302381859~~~Germmare~~~4~~~... but u know Libre-Office ?? ...
mozilla-openoffice.org~~~1314199702~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~LibreOffice is a better choice
mozilla-plugin-gnash~~~1305180637~~~zaenal1234~~~4~~~good, as plugin for web browser.
mozilla-plugin-vlc~~~1274588731~~~Kitsune22~~~1~~~I love VLC, and that is why I uninstalled the mplayer Plugins that come via default and installed this instead. I DO NOT RECOMEND  INSTALLING THIS PLUGIN! While it will play the files once the mplayer Plugin is removed, it has no controls whatsoever, making it effectively useless. Keyboard controls can be used, but they are slow and unresponsive, and files play slower then if simply streamed with the normal VLC. Until this gets an update for these much needed features, STAY AWAY! It isn't worth the effort.
mozilla-plugin-vlc~~~1277122845~~~Dlgeekdu93~~~1~~~Ne marche pas chez moi / Don't work at all at home
mozilla-plugin-vlc~~~1290785192~~~wanda~~~1~~~einfach fuer nichts tauglich .. leider.

mp3gain~~~1299963177~~~samo~~~5~~~Great Program
mp3splt~~~1283938419~~~adirusf~~~5~~~this is a great tools to split mp3. Good work and thanks!
mp3splt-gtk~~~1275016762~~~thx1138~~~4~~~Does the job. You have to do some test projects to understand how this app works.
mpd~~~1306262887~~~marc-koenders~~~5~~~This one does it all, Streaming to Icecast & Shoutcast, Built in http streamserver, OSS4, Alsa, pulseaudio, jack, jack2, avahi. And since its server client model there are alot of clients available.  One thing tho on 64bit this one totally makes skype faint. So I will be on Gmail Talk and Voice.
mpd~~~1307931128~~~dice~~~5~~~the best music player I've ever tried
mplayer~~~1272984226~~~Rovanion~~~5~~~MPlayer is the best video player for Linux. It even beats VLC as long as you are not going to broadcast video over your network. Recommended is to use also add a separate GUI such as SMPlayer to further enhance the experience. All in all, Mplayer is the most feture-complete, resource-efficent movie player out there.
mplayer~~~1274801504~~~farnaby~~~5~~~At the moment the best player available. Plays almost everything.
mplayer~~~1274937317~~~rexc~~~4~~~This is the default player that I use. I'd recommend using a front end like Gnome Mplayer or smplayer. Essentially, this has plays nearly all video formats out of the box.
mplayer~~~1275173938~~~AndrewX192~~~5~~~Great for playing media of any kind, also has a powerful encoder built in. Also has many output drivers.
mplayer~~~1275312754~~~RandyNose~~~4~~~Does a good job of playing Video and Audio files.
mplayer~~~1277411242~~~Twiguard~~~5~~~Using it as a background media support for my own apps, cool multimedia player.
mplayer~~~1279312563~~~dckjnsn~~~4~~~my more-used player as of late
mplayer~~~1280313942~~~linXea~~~4~~~M-player is what all other players aim to be. Easy to use, POWERFUL and yet still lightweight enough to be used on low-spec systems. Works just as good from CLI as from GUI, and it comes more or less fully loaded for any kind of file you ever what to play.
mplayer~~~1280680408~~~romanybob~~~4~~~I use it to play my music, no grief or pomp, just works!
mplayer~~~1282315672~~~cologne~~~2~~~Is installed in Mint-XFCE by default. But Mplayer failed from time to time where other video players (as the lightweight player Parole) did the job. Playing with the settings didn´t help. So for me: No thanks.
mplayer~~~1284582258~~~ozos~~~5~~~sometimes is better than vlc
mplayer~~~1286051462~~~NotStyle~~~2~~~with mint works tragicaly
mplayer~~~1287343158~~~wanda~~~4~~~Zusamen mit SMplayer sehr gut fuer DVD video´s ab zu spielen inclusief untertitelung.
mplayer~~~1288663704~~~sigma-ml~~~4~~~I like its components (mencoder, etc.) more than the player part.
mplayer~~~1288944111~~~jesica~~~1~~~takes up space
mplayer~~~1288945531~~~Elisa~~~5~~~as ozos said, when vlc sux, mplayer or gnomeplaye is the next choice :-)
mplayer~~~1289936297~~~H4x0r18~~~4~~~It gets the job done
mplayer~~~1290015419~~~horcrux~~~5~~~Like VLC but with a tradeoff -- it uses about half the system resources but the interface is clunky.  If your system can't keep up with VLC, mplayer is awesome.
mplayer~~~1292076154~~~noireth~~~4~~~mplayer
mplayer~~~1292097512~~~Simi~~~5~~~great player i used it without any gui. Only with my config. I have fully control on my 6 button mouse. Auto load subtitles and detecting right encoding.
mplayer~~~1292238511~~~Shostako~~~5~~~Very good player, the best with VLC.
mplayer~~~1294596244~~~grim~~~4~~~I used it a lot in the past, loved it even though sometimes it was kinda buggy :\ VLC solved all my problems meanwhile.
mplayer~~~1294612970~~~NumberSeventeen~~~5~~~Togetter with VLC I can play almost anything.
mplayer~~~1294875701~~~Qruqs~~~3~~~Okay I guess.
mplayer~~~1295065724~~~kitzune~~~5~~~el que mejor me a andado aun mejor que smplayer y vlc
mplayer~~~1296597056~~~Jac978~~~4~~~It plays almost everything.
mplayer~~~1302383032~~~Germmare~~~4~~~in connection with VLC !?
mplayer~~~1308228681~~~dice~~~5~~~It have the best UI movie player could possibly have.
mplayer~~~1311939756~~~RavS~~~4~~~Good, but I like VLC most! :)
mplayer-gui~~~1271324195~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~Für mich immer noch der Klassiker bei den Videobetrachtern, wenn ich es auch hasse, das er, nicht immer unbedingt den richtigen Audiotreiber oder den richtigen Videotreiber erwischt, wenn man mal die grafische Oberfläche verläßt, also z.B. von Gnome nach Xfce rüberschwenkt. Kann man mit diesem Manko leben, hat man einen hervorragenden Abspieler, der mit jeder Art von Film klarkommt, sofern die Codecs installiert wurden.

mplayer-gui~~~1286546456~~~zaenal1234~~~2~~~too troublesome, hang, ...etc
mplayer-gui~~~1307212827~~~mysoomro~~~5~~~It is supporting many extensions. I like it. It also has the function of drag and drop directly from the file explorer to the play list.
mplayer-gui~~~1308197083~~~Suhaimighz~~~5~~~Stop complaining about subtiltles, guys. I totally figured it out man. You just have to change your subtitles name to exactly as same as your videos name. Like your videos names is Pirates of Torrent Valley DVDrip.avi and your subtitles text names shoud be Pirates of Torrent Valley DVDrip.srt, and gnome mplayer should load subtitles just fine. Totally figured it out, man. Beautiful
mplayer-gui~~~1310847780~~~Tonya~~~5~~~I like it very much. It plays most files from my media collection.
mplayer-gui~~~1310874860~~~victors~~~2~~~Used mplayer extensively in the past when I compiled it into Fedora 4 but now VLC does everything I need for me in Mint.
mplayer-gui~~~1314527810~~~Warlock~~~5~~~easy to use, even with subtitles
mtpaint~~~1294681337~~~pbmuk~~~4~~~Simple to use and does everything I need re cropping and resizing images etc. Has some issues talking to the clipboard.
mtpaint~~~1281971553~~~strayharmony~~~4~~~Runs well on older hardware. For quick cropping, flipping when The GIMP would be overkill.
mtpaint~~~1298290533~~~Rodpaulo~~~4~~~Simples e prático
mtpaint~~~1302037884~~~gianpv~~~5~~~simple to use, easyest and light photo editor!
mtpaint~~~1315102123~~~mih199~~~5~~~Like ms paint, but not as complicated as gimp

multiget~~~1276653234~~~Heyron~~~5~~~nota 10!!!
multiget~~~1277539641~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~I like it, but it still has some bugs and the application is currently not maintained anylonger. I hope someone will continue fixing and improving this application. I only used it for HTTP downloads and this works well.
multiget~~~1289675470~~~pazuzuthewise~~~2~~~Couldn't move finished download to download folder. Didn't keep an interrupted download in the list, after being shutdown.
multiget~~~1295556478~~~gilshwartz~~~5~~~Looks great and can download from multiple sources - a winning feature.
multiget~~~1295558425~~~Elisa~~~4~~~Good ;-)
multiget~~~1304970338~~~Uewd~~~5~~~Worked awesome! Reminds me of Orbit downloader
multiget~~~1314997795~~~menon~~~5~~~hmm
mumble~~~1274299343~~~ponpat~~~5~~~best voip programm i have ever used
mumble~~~1276381512~~~Rovanion~~~5~~~The best voip application there is. It is server-based, like Ventrilo and TeamSpeak, but superseeds them both in audioquality and delays. So you can have better quality and lower latencies for free.
mumble~~~1287522011~~~jgerry~~~5~~~excellent program
mumble~~~1294221919~~~VK7HSE~~~5~~~great substitute to skype

mupen64plus~~~1275350486~~~dim3000~~~5~~~Performs extremely well, works with all joysticks, many features
mupen64plus~~~1274694361~~~Mbinjavaid~~~4~~~For me, it works as well as the Project64 I was used to before. Good emulator.
mupen64plus~~~1275074924~~~d1eg0_79~~~4~~~excelente emulador, me acompaña en mis mejores ratos libres
mupen64plus~~~1275968524~~~rainserpent~~~1~~~I couldn't get this to work at all and the settings are way too complex. I will stick with Project64, it always works.
mupen64plus~~~1276681717~~~Resilldoux~~~4~~~Great emulator, but why keep this outdated for so long? v1.99.3 is the most recent, you know.
mupen64plus~~~1278928357~~~vipek~~~5~~~Great software! I've just finished Mario 64 on it :) I tried it on 3 different computers and it worked well. Sometimes you have to disable fog in mupen settings.
mupen64plus~~~1284858403~~~talu56~~~5~~~love play goldeneye with it!
mupen64plus~~~1293305784~~~guismo~~~4~~~I guess it is better then project64
mupen64plus~~~1295200386~~~Shostako~~~4~~~A good N64 emulator, but not the best of the scene (project64)
mupen64plus~~~1302896334~~~Alfram~~~2~~~Can't find core files after reinstall
mupen64plus~~~1306729031~~~Marcharious~~~5~~~I love this emulator, It has a few issues in ocarina of time (unable to see link in the men). Besides that thoguh its incredibly stable.
mupen64plus~~~1308320746~~~Timmythepirate~~~4~~~The best N64 emulator for Linux
mupen64plus~~~1314279647~~~Chicoso~~~3~~~The best for linux, but it becomes worst after the GUI removal
mupen64plus~~~1316992912~~~Anleoje~~~3~~~Not bad.... ;)

murrine-themes~~~1309016844~~~obakfahad~~~5~~~Really a very very good theme....
musescore~~~1279097567~~~Liszt~~~5~~~Produces very high quality typeset sheet music. Doesn't have real time note entry and has the occasional bug but the community provide wonderful support. I find it just as quick choosing the note duration using the computer keyboard numbers and you can enter pitches via midi keyboard. Quality of sheet music produced is very high quality.
musescore~~~1289694820~~~goyinux~~~5~~~It's a exellent alternative to sibelius. It has all I need.
musescore~~~1290301140~~~csmayfield~~~5~~~Seriously the best free sheet music editor -- check out the tutorial videos on their website.  Latest stable version available in their PPA.

mypaint~~~1297048101~~~Roku~~~5~~~Excluding Photoshop- the best painting software Ive ever used. I love it! Im suprised it's not more popular. It has many nice options but it's also very easy to use (unlike Gimp). Highly recommended!
mypaint~~~1297851773~~~peileppe~~~5~~~simple and yet powerful : MyPaint has layers, colors palette and many, many brushes, it can export as .png - it's a bit like ArtRage but opensource
mypaint~~~1300916408~~~Dakal~~~5~~~I use it everyday
mypaint~~~1303890891~~~danillius~~~5~~~i love it

mysql-server~~~1314639942~~~trollboy~~~4~~~A web server is not really whole without this. While there are other data storage mechanisms for dynamic sites, none scale as well or as easily. Maria DB is better but not in the repositories

nano~~~1271414968~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~Nano ist ein sehr leicht zu bedienender Texteditor für die Kommandozeile, der leicht von Anfängern verstanden werden kann. Er benötigt keine derart lange Einarbeitungszeit wie z.B. emacs oder vi. Natürlich kann er ebenso erheblich weniger, aber um kurz eine Konfigurationsdatei anzupassen ist er mehr als ausreichend.
nano~~~1275158828~~~AndrewX192~~~4~~~One of the easiest command line text editors out there.
nano~~~1275744043~~~jelevin~~~4~~~I use it every day
nano~~~1276085238~~~vadi01~~~5~~~Really simple. Used vim but its too hard. Nano rocks.

nautilus~~~1268010133~~~conquerortim~~~2~~~Extremely bad file manager. Very slow. Only thing going for it is that it has network and bluetooth browsing.
nautilus~~~1270927408~~~Roin~~~3~~~Nautilus is ok, espacily the network functions make Nautilus to a very usefull File Browser, but untiil it doesnt feature a twin list view it wont get a better rating!
nautilus~~~1275119539~~~AndrewX192~~~4~~~Great when used with gnome, lacks some features, if you want more try dolphin or konqueror
nautilus~~~1290950682~~~Elisa~~~5~~~I like it for its scripts you can add or even write your own scripts :)

nautilus~~~1298848094~~~Mitzh~~~3~~~it's ok, but could use some more feautures
nautilus~~~1300196700~~~horro~~~5~~~Just perfect!
nautilus~~~1300884493~~~m4daredsun~~~4~~~Nautilus is the standard file manager for the Gnome desktop. It is a good tool with plenty of configuration possibilities. However, I have the feeling it is slow and heavy from time to time. PCManFM can be be a valid alternative, especially if your hardware is not so recent
nautilus~~~1302291839~~~bst2~~~3~~~Not bad, but misses much features
nautilus~~~1306572552~~~Dannie~~~5~~~Great file manager!

nautilus-open-terminal~~~1272475742~~~Alexio~~~4~~~Adds a right click menu option to open the terminal, either from the desktop or in a Nautilus directory. If you use it in a Nautilus directory, it will open terminal in that directory. To use it, I always have to log out and back in when I first install it.
nautilus-open-terminal~~~1290039300~~~Fallobst~~~5~~~really simple opening of a terminal in a folder

navit~~~1287701796~~~glen20~~~3~~~Still a long way to go before it comes close to any of the commercial products.
ncmpcpp~~~1308602321~~~marc-koenders~~~5~~~Ok I admit it, I am biased, I like the commandline. This is absolutely the best terminal/console mpd client out there. As soon as you copy /usr/share/doc/ncmpcpp/examples/config.gz to /home/~/.ncmpcpp/ and unzip it, the magic starts with editing the file. Have fun and enjoy!
ndisgtk~~~1304788923~~~SAndrews_18~~~3~~~Havent got it to work Yet, But still trying
ne~~~1298325468~~~minti~~~4~~~Much nicer than nano -- a good contender for replacing vi and emacs in a pinch.

network-manager~~~1275122610~~~AndrewX192~~~4~~~Powerful backend for managing networks on linux, does great with laptops, see wicd as a alternative if this doesn't meet your needs.
network-manager~~~1275526868~~~rexc~~~4~~~It's continually getting better with each release. I remember when it shipped without a "disconnect vpn" option. Which meant you had to disconnect your connection completely. It has supports quite a few VPNs - pptp, openvpn.
network-manager~~~1276901231~~~Flaviy~~~1~~~frequently creates  new Auto Ethernet connection and doesn't show created by me.

neverball~~~1295176820~~~Jac978~~~4~~~Nice graphics and great fun.
neverball~~~1296001178~~~mca53~~~1~~~Truly awful - the opening screens wouldn't stop flashing, the movement is dizzying, and the controls are nonexistent (even the mouse cursor disappeared; I couldn't click on the "x" to close the window). Uninstalled after maybe 3 minutes.
neverball~~~1297098584~~~flan_suse~~~4~~~Nice and pretty. A good way to relax and kill time. Can be played even on slow computers.

neverball~~~1307188618~~~stighy~~~4~~~Nice funny game
neverball~~~1308741329~~~steve470~~~5~~~I'm shocked that this is only rated four stars. Based on the main game of Super Monkey Ball, but a good bit better than the original, IMO.

neverputt~~~1278775977~~~Noigileron~~~4~~~Très bon jeux !
neverputt~~~1278822237~~~Petalshine~~~4~~~cool
neverputt~~~1279107332~~~Liszt~~~4~~~Works well - challenging levels though the courses could have a little more personality
neverputt~~~1281029302~~~zrebec~~~2~~~It's funny for multiplayer but that's all. I missing better graphics, smoother animations and sound effects (like in Madagascar Minigolf minigame)
neverputt~~~1281714555~~~Jac978~~~4~~~Great attractive game which one runs well on older PC's (My suggested screenshot taken with Geforce 5700LE).
neverputt~~~1291660178~~~marksuci~~~5~~~Odli?na i izazovna igrica
neverputt~~~1295926449~~~beazongirls~~~5~~~I'm not very good yet but its a great game
neverputt~~~1298166806~~~markovian~~~5~~~This is a very fun game. Simple to learn, but still very hard to be really good at.

neverputt~~~1306556363~~~mint10user~~~5~~~The tricky golf course one is almost impossible! Anyways, its a fun game
neverputt~~~1308741414~~~steve470~~~5~~~By far the best game of its kind, though frustrating when you hit a good shot that takes a weird bounce out of bounds, as happens from time to time.
neverputt~~~1311865107~~~mintlinux~~~4~~~Good neverball follow-up.
neverputt~~~1314336123~~~registereduser~~~1~~~no golf course i have ever seen is shaped like these, or have difficult to avoid obstacles (pretty much impossible objects) this game isn't fun it's a pain :( i wanted to play golf, not impossible nightmare.
newsbeuter~~~1294818328~~~robertofmj~~~5~~~Incredible console feed reader. Support opml files, rss, atom and have a intuitive menu. Superior than Snownews and Canto.
nexuiz~~~1267684818~~~HANAX~~~4~~~you think that UT was fast? Try this ;)
nexuiz~~~1268227335~~~woockash~~~1~~~Looks and feels crappy. Totally booooorring...
nexuiz~~~1270871190~~~NineDegrees~~~5~~~great game
nexuiz~~~1271219484~~~RedWagon~~~4~~~Nexuiz has a lot of cool features and the best graphics of any open source game I've ever seen but for some reason I still prefer Quake III or Open Arena.  I think the amount of weapons and modes is a little overwhelming.  Either way, if you like first person shooters and shiny colorful objects you should try this game.
nexuiz~~~1271359007~~~kunk~~~4~~~Reminds me of Unreal Tournament which I enjoyed too.
nexuiz~~~1271365485~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~Nexuiz has gone a long way and it looks great so far. Now that Illfonic jumped into the picture, I hopefully expect that the game will benefit from this partnership. I only wish the models would look better. Hence my rating.
nexuiz~~~1273396629~~~noss~~~5~~~Bardzo dobra strzelanka!
nexuiz~~~1273426579~~~blueyedwonder~~~5~~~Extremely fast paced shooter and above average graphics.
nexuiz~~~1273682374~~~filippo333~~~5~~~An amazing alternative to Unreal Tournament!
nexuiz~~~1274530271~~~M4t3us~~~3~~~Could be better, this kind of game is a little too beaten around the bush. Nothing new.
nexuiz~~~1274632155~~~dupasqk~~~5~~~Its freekin awsome. Fast and pretty.
nexuiz~~~1274757334~~~darkwaymcdan~~~2~~~I wouldnt recoment this game.  Its way to fast for my liking.  Messy too
nexuiz~~~1275730771~~~begrebela~~~4~~~It has a useful tutorial, cool music, rolling gameplay but I could imagine some improvements like a new mod with real weapons.
nexuiz~~~1276095072~~~eiver~~~5~~~Best FPS on Linux. Fast, unreal-like, never boring.
nexuiz~~~1276828426~~~cardinal4~~~5~~~Very fun! I've grown up practically playing WW2 FPS, but this halo-style FPS is pretty good! Graphics is decent among Linux games, and the gameplay is addictive! Had a lot of fun on Single Player already. =) Very good for a quick stress relief.
nexuiz~~~1277693802~~~ohfine~~~4~~~??????

nexuiz~~~1279604729~~~sipiatti~~~5~~~Try it!
nexuiz~~~1280599980~~~GiantEnemyCat~~~4~~~Good gameplay and graphics. That's all there is to it. Menu theme is totally a rip-off of Halo, though. lol.
nexuiz~~~1280660910~~~selekta77~~~5~~~Mein lieblingsspiel :-)
nexuiz~~~1281199234~~~fanisatt~~~5~~~The game of the games ...... It's splendid.
nexuiz~~~1281208501~~~Mito~~~5~~~The best FPS on linux... very good graphics, sound effects and gameplay.
nexuiz~~~1281744356~~~Raven95~~~4~~~Good Alternative To Unreal Tournament
nexuiz~~~1283277568~~~Martinimaster~~~5~~~for free online games, seriously good!
nexuiz~~~1284237818~~~gnsdrv~~~3~~~Just because it's free...
nexuiz~~~1284838476~~~DiGiTaL-CORE~~~5~~~Its a cool game, especially for free. Im just bad at it :P
nexuiz~~~1286023892~~~ReckouNT~~~3~~~??????)
nexuiz~~~1287533022~~~sythe~~~4~~~Good game, but a little bit too fast-paced.
nexuiz~~~1289569228~~~therayzor~~~4~~~Shouldn't the size be 803Meg not KB
nexuiz~~~1289704102~~~Elfo087~~~2~~~Graficamente troppo scarso, e livelli non sono di alto livello... anzi. Forse se c'è molta gente può diventare interessante.
nexuiz~~~1289845993~~~zata~~~4~~~like it !!

nexuiz~~~1294268959~~~kojimairiguchi~~~4~~~lo kiero
nexuiz~~~1295140634~~~Brian_Foxglove~~~5~~~This is perhaps the best free shooting game one the web. Although its fast-paced action is very different from most modern first-person shooter games, it is still quite a fun and addicting marvel. You can play for hours or just a few minutes.
nexuiz~~~1295174581~~~Jac978~~~4~~~As good as UT was me.
nexuiz~~~1297412220~~~asedt~~~3~~~Looks good, butt freezes/crash for me all the time, even in the menu. Total size is around 879 MB if counting game-data, music and textures. On home page this is called classic, a new game for XBLA/PS3/steam is on the way later 2011 i think.
nexuiz~~~1297624225~~~daedra333~~~5~~~Fun and inspiring gameplay make this game a must play with great graphics!
nexuiz~~~1297711676~~~spyngamerman~~~5~~~love it its nice and fun and fast

nexuiz~~~1310421263~~~tamoghna4~~~3~~~nice game, but huge size, hard to download!
nexuiz~~~1310796624~~~ericslinux~~~3~~~Not very challenging when your competition is other Linux players.   Nice graphics tho but endless kill streaks get kind of old after a while.
nexuiz~~~1312132020~~~blueXrider~~~3~~~boring
nexuiz~~~1312311102~~~mih199~~~3~~~It takes forever to download, and it might have been more fun if it ran faster on my laptop. Srsly, this game ran slower than windows on a tiny processer
nexuiz~~~1312595056~~~Sol_Badguy~~~4~~~It's a nice game!
nexuiz~~~1313586500~~~gregyboy234~~~5~~~perfect. i love a game with lots of weapons

nginx~~~1322051613~~~TitusX~~~5~~~Best webserver ever. Fast, small and extremely flexible. You can set and overwrite nearly every option on different levels - e.g. logfiles at global level, at server level or per path match. Try to use it with the new php5-fmp (fcgi) and php-apc (opcode-cacher).

ntpdate~~~1308582871~~~Ioseph~~~4~~~Not much attention given to such a useful package. This keeps your clock accurate by automatically updating over the network. Opposed to rdate being manual.

nvidia-current~~~1297821646~~~Flaker~~~3~~~old and buggy on suspend/resume. Known issue. Time to update!!!
nvidia-current~~~1308843458~~~AlbertP~~~2~~~If it works at all, it's a good driver, but often it fails to run. And setting up 2nd screen is much easier when using the experimental driver. If you don't need to run the most powerful games and your card is not a GeForce GT/GTS/GTX 4xx/5xx, the experimental driver (libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental) is much better.
nvidia-glx-185-dev~~~1304811506~~~nusx~~~5~~~il est bien

nvidia-settings~~~1288299688~~~Winco~~~2~~~Initial Mint install had nice resolution.  I also this tool, but can only get 640x480 max.

nvidia-settings~~~1298848763~~~Mitzh~~~4~~~it works.. thoug I have encountered minor bugs when setting up multiple screens
nvidia-settings~~~1302645806~~~roguededguy~~~5~~~Has more features to tweak than I have ever needed. Makes dual monitors plug and play.
nvidia-settings~~~1303993129~~~raiyan1~~~4~~~If you have an Nvidia graphics card this tool can be very useful. It has lots of features like cursor shadow, screen resolution and others. It also shows GPU temperature and Graphics Card information.
nvidia-settings~~~1308843207~~~AlbertP~~~2~~~Lots of features but configuring 2nd screen is a pain

octave3.2~~~1274734276~~~heltonbiker~~~5~~~A must have for anyone working with scientific or mathematical data
octave3.2~~~1278016992~~~dbpatankar~~~3~~~Good one. But runs slower than its commercial equivalent as per my experience.
octave3.2~~~1283412168~~~linux1492~~~5~~~One of the good MatLab clones. Great tool for scientific applications. One has to mention that some releases do differ in syntax or even some commands drop out for some releases only to appear much later again.
octave3.2~~~1284581842~~~ozos~~~5~~~very useful for my math courses
octave3.2~~~1286480168~~~iranquintero~~~5~~~Muy buena alternativa a Matlab

octave3.2~~~1302680774~~~m4daredsun~~~3~~~Not bad but I prefer [python + numpy + scipy + matplotlib] for scientific/technical computing and data processing
octave3.2~~~1305203842~~~farnaby~~~3~~~i agree with m4daredsun. octave is a nice matlab-clone, almost (!) as good as the original. however, python + matplotlib + spyder is an open source concept that in many aspects already outruns matlab.
octave3.2~~~1305231909~~~asymmetros~~~5~~~A must for mathematics-statistics work.
octave3.2~~~1313861809~~~allwires~~~5~~~Great matlab alternative. Just beware that not all scripts created with Matlab if that is what you are using it for.

ogmrip~~~1284729146~~~jerom~~~5~~~Simple & powerful, what else to ask for? Default 'Extreme' Quality settings result in lengthy encoding - 7 hours Xvid on P4D - and can be lowered to 'High' or 'Normal' => 2 hours.

ogmrip~~~1296135903~~~Inoki~~~4~~~With all of its features surpasses all of the available in the repos, but still is very slow at compiling a disc, drains the CPU heavily (using a hyper-threaded dual-core by the way) and still came up with errors or hang the PC. Other than that, superb quality of the outcoming file. Best ripper ever made. If the devs make the improvements I mentioned this app will be the king of all ripping software.

okular~~~1290326165~~~thrillseeker~~~4~~~I agree--it's better than Evince. I prefer Gnome for it's look & feel, but I have to admit, many KDE apps are just plain better than their Gnome equivalents.
okular~~~1290744446~~~Fhernd~~~5~~~It's so functional!
okular~~~1291205080~~~DJPhil~~~5~~~Seems to be an excellent replacement for Adobe's reader. Uses KDE libraries, so not very lightweight for gnome users. Was difficult to find in Software Manager but worth it.

oolite~~~1275421873~~~mauricep~~~5~~~Old. But classic, playable, open-ended and addictive. They don't make 'em like this anymore!
oolite~~~1276779036~~~vipek~~~2~~~Really not good. It's a kind of game, where you don't know what to do :)
oolite~~~1285878100~~~alexandre_ko~~~5~~~I am very glad to meet this beautiful game on linux!
oolite~~~1295188775~~~ayearhasgone~~~5~~~I'm completely addicted.  Highly playable and customizable, but 1.65 is out-of-date.
oolite~~~1297340074~~~dajunka~~~5~~~Fantastic. I love this game, but where is the latest version?  The Linux mint bosses need sacking. :)
oolite~~~1304863644~~~trollboy~~~5~~~If you loved Elite, this is for you. Trade, bounty hunt, salvage or pirate your way to the rank of Elite in this open ended game in which the word "Harmless" is the greatest insult! But, please devs can we have the latest version in the repositories as it has come on a long long way?
oolite~~~1309227966~~~jimmyjazz951~~~5~~~Classic. Loved Elite on my C64. Oolite continues on.

openarena~~~1267656318~~~clem~~~4~~~Good game.
openarena~~~1271219623~~~RedWagon~~~5~~~Exactly like Quake III except you can install it with a single command.
openarena~~~1271328697~~~woockash~~~2~~~Could be better. Good clone of Q3, but the maps and the avatars are much too colorful. The rest is ok.
openarena~~~1271329482~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~OpenArena ist das Programm zum Actiondaddeln auf Netbooks, da es dort einfach am besten läuft. Wer natürlich noch FAKK2 und/oder Quake3 herumliegen hat, kann dies ebensogut nutzen. Von der Bedienung her ist es einfach, es bietet aber auch nicht die vielfältigen Möglichkeiten, die mit Warsow oder Alien Arena einhergehen. Am liebsten mag ich das Scharfschützengewehr, leider gibt es nur 2 schöne Scharfschützenkarten.

openarena~~~1288892688~~~LordOfFrost~~~5~~~Cool game. Nobody cares that it's a piece of museum, cuz it's really great fun to play OA sometimes.
openarena~~~1289064908~~~boggle~~~5~~~Great game, even better if you have a bunch of old computers and friends to network with.
openarena~~~1290207566~~~vaillant~~~5~~~Wondeful gaming experience.
openarena~~~1290412016~~~LinuxGreen~~~4~~~For those who don't like Quake but respect the engine, check out Urban Terror (also on get-deb). It's a CS clone.

openbox~~~1271611522~~~justin~~~5~~~Lovely minimal window manager.  Can be completely customized by way of menus and scripts.  It is not full-featured like a desktop environment, rather that part is left to the user.

openoffice.org~~~1271203423~~~jkw~~~5~~~A complete office suite for a price that only includes the download time and the time to install it. Had "Convert to PDF" in OpenOffice Write ages before commercial Microsoft Office Word had it. Ehough said.

openoffice.org~~~1286321989~~~awong~~~4~~~No need to pay for MS Office to run in WINE; very good compatibilty with new MS Office files, unless the files are very complex.  Easy to add dictionaries.  Some cross platform formatting issues with more complex documents.  Overall very good software package for office use.
openoffice.org~~~1290252796~~~wanda~~~5~~~Sehr schwer aber gut ,dabei ich brauche die fuer mein powerpoints zu sehn und zu bearbeidten.
openoffice.org~~~1287521873~~~frankeinstein~~~4~~~Top opensource office suite. I have used it daily over the years. Will being interesting to see if LibreOffice really will knock it off top spot when up and running.
openoffice.org~~~1287969999~~~Sol_Badguy~~~5~~~Excellent to work.

openoffice.org~~~1290405386~~~killmess~~~5~~~It's great! But it would be nice if there were alternatives of the same level of compatibility in GnomeOffice or Koffice. I'm waiting anxiously to try the new Libreoffice.

openoffice.org~~~1291763722~~~luisnando~~~2~~~There is no substitute for ms office at the moment on linux.
openoffice.org~~~1291767839~~~merelyjim~~~4~~~An amazing application, but problems with Excel macros. Also, ties to Sun Microsystems, and thus Oracle, may lead to problems in the future.
openoffice.org~~~1292323163~~~Shostako~~~4~~~Good suite, but very far from the lastest MS Offices. Also, LibreOffice will succed OpenOffice in the near future, due to Oracle OS/FS policies.
openoffice.org~~~1292433714~~~RavS~~~4~~~Well if u don't want to throw in any money, this is the best suite out there. Trying its best but still scope of lot of improvement.

openoffice.org~~~1295483066~~~nicu~~~3~~~Good alternative for MS Office
openoffice.org~~~1296272955~~~mutput7~~~5~~~It's AWESOME! It slowly became a WONDERFUL alternative to MS Office, and the only reason I would choose Office from this is because of the VB macro scripting (Where it is possible to design full applications in an easy to learn programming language. Sorry if I'm advertising...).
openoffice.org~~~1296629908~~~Ashurii~~~5~~~Best alternative to microsoft office! Also runs faster on linux mint than it does on macs snow leopard.
openoffice.org~~~1297511095~~~Le_Pat~~~4~~~Look also at LibreOffice
openoffice.org~~~1298464631~~~luupphar~~~5~~~Great tool set indeed!

openoffice.org~~~1301142726~~~jasonjohnwells~~~1~~~Oracle has not been keeping up with Libre Office in bug fixes.  I hope Mint community will consider replacing it with Libre Office and supporting the Document Foundation
openoffice.org~~~1301153188~~~riki~~~3~~~Can't wait for LibreOffice (in synaptic) to be able to play music with PPSs
openoffice.org~~~1301232604~~~loukoumas~~~4~~~very good
openoffice.org~~~1301245885~~~AlbertP~~~4~~~Not very easy to crop/rotate images but it is a fine office suite for Linux. The .docx support is not yet 100% OK but converting .docx to .doc or .odf using MS Word solves this.
openoffice.org~~~1301469402~~~ilAli~~~3~~~it is better than nothing! its user interface is ugly and i think MS Office is the best
openoffice.org~~~1301472329~~~sheldonh~~~2~~~Will do what I need it to do but MS Office is a far better product.

openoffice.org~~~1304181604~~~menta1789~~~5~~~PADRISIMO
openoffice.org~~~1304294420~~~jt_morris~~~3~~~It's not bad.  In fact, if MS Office 2003 - 2010 didn't exist, then this would be a really good office suite.  But MS Office is MUCH smoother and more streamlined, and has more features.  Overall, this is an acceptable office suite, especially for the price (free), but it trails behind the competition.
openoffice.org~~~1304490642~~~omansoft~~~4~~~good, but we must encourage people to use ODF format because DOC/DOCX are not 100% readable (because Micosoft don't respect standards)
openoffice.org~~~1304602268~~~sayan_acharjee~~~4~~~Good replacement of MS office in linux.
openoffice.org~~~1304606424~~~Aleksandar~~~5~~~Really good Office suite. I use it in win and linux, it supports more languages than MS Office. And is free :-)
openoffice.org~~~1305376191~~~trollboy~~~2~~~It's not a bad office suite, but the Libre Office fork is faster, smoother and truly free (as in speech as well as beer). I think that Libre Office is the default in Mint 11
openoffice.org~~~1305703576~~~CDEX~~~5~~~Un paquete ofimático serio y capaz. Funciona bien y cubre las expectativas. Imprescindible.
openoffice.org~~~1306422059~~~dazw2000~~~4~~~Love Open Office just as much as Libre Office
openoffice.org~~~1306571842~~~Dannie~~~2~~~It works pretty good, but now it's a dead project and there is LibreOffice.

openoffice.org~~~1307284398~~~c1pr1an~~~5~~~Libreoffice is more better
openoffice.org~~~1307847405~~~dumsterdave~~~4~~~I actually prefer this over MS Office. Good stuff
openoffice.org~~~1308238656~~~chi_julia~~~4~~~I like Openoffice, but its days seem to be numbered.  Libreoffice, of course, owes a lot to this suite, and seems to be the way to go in the near future.

openoffice.org~~~1314617452~~~tecknomage~~~4~~~Use v3.2, because 3.3 does not pring Manual Page Breaks on spreadsheets

openoffice.org~~~1318062327~~~mitanshugamer~~~4~~~Libre office is better...
openoffice.org~~~1319383067~~~linuxfanatik~~~5~~~If you replace Open Office with LibreOffice as I mentioned below, (above), whatever, you can use it on a Microsoft System &#40;if you want to be in a prison environment&#41; or on your Macbook -fi you have one since It caters for all operating systems. It doesn't have the ribbon that Microsoft uses in Office 7 and 10 but as this is essentally a tabbed area, it is only a matter of time before LibreOffice adds this feature to itself, also!
openoffice.org~~~1319835346~~~veritas~~~1~~~deprecated, use LibreOffice instead, it is a more free and better software.
openoffice.org~~~1320865167~~~ammaretto~~~4~~~Libre more free and smal better...
openoffice.org~~~1321949304~~~Thecal714~~~1~~~OO.o was the reason I couldn't recommend Linux to most people. It was just awful. Libre Office is headed in the right direction. Try there.

openoffice.org-calc~~~1291310940~~~p999t~~~5~~~Why comment if you don't use it ? this is a great package . I hold all my financial data on it and have done so for 3-4 years.

openoffice.org-writer~~~1277330323~~~VDSA~~~5~~~easily one of the best open source desktop applications
openoffice.org-writer~~~1277956226~~~Kitsune22~~~2~~~I've been using this program for years now, and until very recently, I would not have hesitated to give it a full recommendation. There is a reason it is the default in almost every version of Linux: it has all the features of word (with add-ones), and seemed very stable-- three or so years without losing a document is pretty impressive to me. Even during power outrages, this thing always managed to give my work back to me, and I grew accustomed to using it and even depending on it. It open Microsoft word files, and any other document really, without any problems-- formatting or otherwise. But now, I highly recommend keeping this program away from important work. After years of stable use, in the last few weeks it has left me with a 0kb document SEVREAL TIMES, with the backup also being 0kb and no hope of recovery-- the file was just GONE. This has happened more than once, and this last time it has cost me days of work. Each time, I had saved the file normally. This program, as it is currently, is unstable and unreliable. And that is a sad thing, because it used to be my most relied on program... Now, I recommend Abiword or some other alternative over this, at least until this crucial bug is fixed.
openoffice.org-writer~~~1279647308~~~ivanovnegro~~~5~~~For me the full replacement of Word. I like opensource software and when you learn to use it, it just works like Word.
openoffice.org-writer~~~1280278568~~~newchieng~~~4~~~An able replacement for MS Word, but recently getting heavier with more added features. For those who just need a plain Jane word processor, Abiword would be more suitable.
openoffice.org-writer~~~1280663757~~~selekta77~~~5~~~Perfekt. Mehr kann man da nicht sagen!
openoffice.org-writer~~~1280787786~~~timloyal~~~4~~~just works
openoffice.org-writer~~~1282464585~~~Jinryu~~~5~~~Works great.  I would mostly stick to working in the ODT format and doing as little reconversion as possible, since the porting of MS .doc files isn't exactly perfect, and these imperfections get exacerbated by constant conversion.
openoffice.org-writer~~~1282601114~~~iclozm~~~5~~~I do online school and have been able to completely use Linux for my coursework because of OpenOffice. Bravo.
openoffice.org-writer~~~1282867463~~~colej84~~~3~~~i like it

openoffice.org-writer~~~1287830811~~~vviskari~~~5~~~Excellent! Has really matured and can be used for daily work. Can do PDF exports and supports MS Office doc format (at some level). Wrote my master's thesis with OO. It was great.

openoffice.org-writer~~~1297137694~~~flan_suse~~~4~~~I used OpenOffice.org until LibreOffice released the stable version. LibreOffice is where the magic is happening, and the GO-oo extensions and Novell enhancements are no longer going to Oracle, but instead LibreOffice exclusively.
openoffice.org-writer~~~1297217083~~~cmaew04~~~4~~~I love it, but it is suppose to be a replacement for MS Word, but when my teachers open my finished projects on their Word programs they look all messed up. It claims that it will format things just like Word, but I have not been able to get it to do so.
openoffice.org-writer~~~1298847550~~~Mitzh~~~4~~~it does the job, just don't make fancy stuff if you want to open it in ms-word

openshot~~~1279242079~~~ardvark~~~4~~~Just starting to work with it but so far its great.
openshot~~~1279566267~~~dick~~~4~~~The best so far.  Wish list, create a DVD/CD, more properties using "effects", and audio overlay.
openshot~~~1280587185~~~nixnine~~~4~~~Open shot is an excellent video editor.  The multi-track capability is a notable advantage over other similar programs.  The program works great most times, with an occassional crash.  Other than that, the effects and transitions are more than enough for those seriously involved with video editing.  Many programs are concerned with just the effects, the transitions, etc.  A serious editor will not be using dozens of different transitions in a video.  It's overkill and quite annoying.  Building a video from pictures and snippets of video, what have you, is done very well in openshot and I would highly recommend it.

openshot~~~1304931346~~~SoulReaver~~~2~~~I'm seriously wondering about those who gave this 5 stars.  This program looks incredibly promising, but it is actually incredibly buggy.  I'm trying to put a video clip onto the timeline, but the program then goes all out of wack. Needs work.

opera~~~1267643374~~~clem~~~5~~~One of the best browser out there. It's a pity it's not open-source.

opera~~~1267658160~~~Mdyter~~~4~~~yep.. a good browser. try it)

opera~~~1267661909~~~Truthfinder~~~4~~~Opera has problems with some sites (forms,displaying properly). Overall though it's a very good alternative to Firefox...
opera~~~1267666375~~~SeanBest~~~3~~~It's ok, but can't compete with Firefox and it's addons.

opera~~~1270820480~~~XidCat~~~5~~~Not Open Source, but oh well. New 10.52 build is fastest browser I've used.
opera~~~1270870616~~~NineDegrees~~~1~~~It doesnt work on 85% of the websites I visit.  Its worthless.
opera~~~1271322558~~~captainhaggy~~~5~~~Der Opera schlägt den in die Jahre gekommenen Firefox um Längen, ist benutzerfreundlicher, innovativer und äußerst schnell in der Darstellung von Webseiten. Dieser Browser ist stets die erste Wahl, wenn es um einen Webbrowser geht.

opera~~~1271370360~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~Excellent browser! I do however miss the great web developer tools available for Firefox. Dragonfly still needs development.

opera~~~1274255560~~~markavino~~~5~~~An excellent browser
opera~~~1274277373~~~Emil~~~4~~~Good alternative to Firefox; sleeker design, but gives no indication when communicating with servers. Intuitive interface, but comes with commercial junk (amazon, ask, kayak) set as defaults.
opera~~~1274286207~~~trans~~~5~~~a great all in one browser;mail,feed reader,torrent,file sharing,fast n good interface
opera~~~1274287348~~~zroo3d~~~5~~~for me the best browser, but looks ugly in gnome
opera~~~1274301372~~~M4t3us~~~2~~~With a lot of improvements it could rival Firefox, but as it is, not even the plugins could possibly raise it up to acceptable range.
opera~~~1274317573~~~sparky~~~5~~~I've been all the way around the browser block more than a couple of times.  Nothing compares to Opera in its ability to keep everything in sync.  At home (mint), at work (windoze), and on the go (blackberry) it is my favorite browser..
opera~~~1274375184~~~gonye~~~5~~~One of the best!
opera~~~1274381497~~~arnaldo~~~5~~~Exelente Navegador... con muchas funciones que hacen mas agradable la navegacion. No necesita agregados!!!
opera~~~1274387792~~~IOTA368~~~3~~~Nice and quick, but nothing special. I stay with firefox (and chromium for little things)
opera~~~1274483331~~~eddy77france~~~5~~~Un must concurrent de safari
opera~~~1274519411~~~salli~~~5~~~the best thing is the included email function
opera~~~1282464461~~~Jinryu~~~3~~~It's nice if you're using slower connections (or downloading like there's no tomorrow) but it doesn't always render pages as correctly as Firefox or Chromium.  Java applets tend to do strange things in Opera, or not show up at all.  The extended features such as Unite though are quite cool-- I'd say it's useful for sharing and the extended features, which is why I'm giving it as many stars as I do, but as a browser, stick to Chromium or Firefox
opera~~~1274634161~~~Jess~~~5~~~The best choice
opera~~~1274693690~~~arola~~~5~~~best!
opera~~~1274702394~~~majortws~~~3~~~Fast but ugly.
opera~~~1314220205~~~MGinity~~~5~~~Must! É o melhor browser com leitor de email (IMAP) para linux, android, ...
opera~~~1275798251~~~Pariah~~~5~~~Opera has been my favourite browser since Firefox 2.  I love how it has things built in and for use out of the box without requiring extensions that bloat it.  I'm always a click away from my email and chat.  Opera Link does my synching for me and Opera can be skinned without having to restart!  Mouse Gestures and Speed Dial are indespensible
opera~~~1274755377~~~tutungzone~~~5~~~I love it... use it on both Winblows and Linux boxes alike, and it puts FF and IE to shame.
opera~~~1274807202~~~nicogon93~~~4~~~good browser
opera~~~1274813630~~~Timor~~~2~~~Chrome is the best!
opera~~~1274856974~~~dragonias~~~5~~~Opera is the fastest, most stable, most secure and Web standards conforming browser around. Opera Rules! :D
opera~~~1274871705~~~razernon~~~3~~~Efficient and secure, but Firefox and Chromium beats it in speed.
opera~~~1274889883~~~skretzchy~~~5~~~I'm in Love since 5.12
opera~~~1274947211~~~estefan211~~~5~~~I love this browser. Opera browser is very fastest and cool! (recomiendo para todos)
opera~~~1275017119~~~thx1138~~~4~~~Equal to Midori and Chromium in speed, but much more user friendly with additional plug ins.
opera~~~1275127395~~~rappelkiste_src~~~5~~~Sehr schneller Browser, sehr gute Arbeitsergonomie. So muss er von Hause aus nicht mit Plugins nachgerüstet werden. Plugins sind aber möglich.
opera~~~1275147696~~~fjfortis~~~5~~~Es el mejor navegador web

opera~~~1275592076~~~koko~~~5~~~Super fast and stable browser. Has all the features I need built in (I don't need to install 3rd party addons). Always the leader in innovations.
opera~~~1275604775~~~critom~~~4~~~I have used this since around version 3.5. If like me you only occasionally download a torrent or use chat then this is the browser for you. It is a very quick good browser which has a built in email client also it has basic torrent, chat and news feed support along with other features. The odds are that the features you like in other browsers were seen in opera first.
opera~~~1275748864~~~afterburner~~~5~~~great browser
opera~~~1275820877~~~Abboff~~~5~~~The best browser!
opera~~~1277482522~~~Griemel~~~5~~~fast browser with good email client

opera~~~1275954657~~~canislupus~~~1~~~ugly, not that fast (at linux at least) no adblock!!!
opera~~~1276032369~~~Wishmaster84~~~5~~~very nice browser!!!
opera~~~1276039588~~~Spike941~~~4~~~Good, but problems wish flash and some buttons don't work in Linux
opera~~~1276045146~~~Centaur~~~5~~~Awesome Browser, especially the new Opera 10.60a (which has gtk support). Also Opera has a content blocker, and you can download lists, that will act the same as Firefox's adblock.
opera~~~1276486276~~~Innis87~~~2~~~when i tried using it, it didn't seem to work for me. its little speed mutiplier slowed the thing to a point where i turned it off, uninstalled it,  opened Firefox, and surffed happily away. it seems to have a lot of good reviews though, so maybe i should give it a second chance.

opera~~~1276922964~~~khai~~~5~~~I used it since it become free. First in Win, now in Mint. Like it more than FF.
opera~~~1276993983~~~SxFlare~~~5~~~Great browser, lot of handy functions like Turbo and non-load-images to save bandwidth to those who have limited. Customizable hotkeys and I like the new look in 10.60(beta). It just lacks a good RSS reader like FF, but has widgets for that.
opera~~~1277016296~~~plaguethenet~~~1~~~Chrome is so much better.
opera~~~1277117559~~~CeleronD~~~4~~~decent but it's no chrome. Abit Cluttered in comparision.

opera~~~1278301350~~~ThomasB2k~~~3~~~Very good, but it always seemed a bit slower than Firefox. I love how everything like IRC and email was integrated though.
opera~~~1278307595~~~baffle-boy~~~3~~~not really that fast, no really good plugins, and the GUI is cluttered with useless features that i dont want... that exist in ifrefox through optional plugins.
opera~~~1278318032~~~robertofmj~~~5~~~Opera 10.60 is now GTK2+. This browser has many years of life. Mouse gestures, speed dial native. Fast, light, elegant like Mint. The best choice !

opera~~~1278702738~~~andrei~~~5~~~Excellent. Not many people knows that it also contains full featured mail client which is far better then many competitors
opera~~~1278765666~~~ElPresidente86~~~5~~~Good UI, lots of features.
opera~~~1278899973~~~Larro~~~5~~~Nice suite of web apps

opera~~~1278933344~~~muninnhuginn~~~5~~~Loved it under Windows, love it even more with its Mint-y go faster stripes. More robust, too. My email database ported over from Win to Mint flawlessly, too.
opera~~~1279006314~~~ffabris~~~2~~~I find the UI to be unfriendly, but realzie that's personal.
opera~~~1279012030~~~Clasier~~~5~~~Really good browser, works like charm. But still got "some tiny problems" whit Linux.. And Opera needs that damn Ad-Block !! =P
opera~~~1279213778~~~seelenfreund~~~5~~~Der Browser kann alles was ich brauche, und das auch noch gut! Mausgesten, MailClient, Feeds, ... Opera ist meine Nr 1 unter den Browsern. Schnell, zuverlässig, flexibel konfigurierbar und praktisch!!
opera~~~1279219947~~~mantas~~~5~~~Al jaren mijn favo browser
opera~~~1279464363~~~ivanovnegro~~~4~~~Good as Firefox but its not opensource and hasnt got a real adblocker.

opera~~~1280276668~~~71KR117~~~5~~~This browsers nice, but you should download the one on their site. It's newer and uses GTK.
opera~~~1280408724~~~linXea~~~5~~~Extremely good browser, only draw-back is that it's not open-source.
opera~~~1280543185~~~enoW~~~4~~~still love it
opera~~~1280557134~~~Copyleft~~~5~~~Great browser. Too bad it isn't open source.

opera~~~1280717911~~~DesertJim~~~5~~~fastest yet
opera~~~1280746250~~~taconi~~~4~~~Otimo
opera~~~1285342109~~~elscripto~~~4~~~Opera 10.10+ with Unite is an entire new experience. Forget about configuration of relatively complex file share services on you computer, but instead easily share files and pictures with your trusted friends, or listen to your music directly from your remote computer, or allow friends to upload files directly to your computer bypassing the setup of FTP services, or even more ... provide an easy way for access to your home grown Web Server.
opera~~~1281105563~~~Celtique~~~5~~~il mériterait d'être sur la 1ere marche du podium
opera~~~1281544453~~~donald_duck~~~5~~~Better... Faster... Stronger
opera~~~1281702651~~~reeboker~~~5~~~I like the synchronization service because anytime I install a ne distro or do re-installation, I would not lost bookmarks, or my customized speed dial and so on. Also great if you're switching between linux and windows because the synchronization works independently between OSes. And for the Unite service, what could be more great whenever you come to your friends house and with custom link you can browse your shared files on your home pc. :)

opera~~~1314209264~~~navigator1~~~5~~~Opera is superb, fast,safe, standards compliant, comes with an email client, which is very much in line with their browser's safety philosofy. Yes, it is not open source but  I like that, just because I don't want to see two hundred flavors of it. what opera does is, it allows you to navigate easily, fast, safe without missing  anything so you can go on with your life, in other words you are not a slave of the browser . this is a lean and mean machine, I wish most software were like that
opera~~~1291889931~~~horro~~~5~~~Fast, evolutionary, best features and most secure browser around.

opera~~~1283711968~~~mul14~~~5~~~This is great web browser.
opera~~~1283740653~~~ron_o~~~4~~~It's the best browser you'll ever use, except it doesn't render all pages as well as it could and flash has never worked fully. But for a fast web browser with mouse gestures and the like, if speed is what you like then Opera is the browser for you.
opera~~~1283962260~~~tamoghna4~~~2~~~i tried it once, but chrome gave me no reason to make it as my default.

opera~~~1292903622~~~jahwarrior4179~~~4~~~Really good browser but lacks the add-ons that firefox and Chrome have.  The ones they do have are good if you can get them to work (even in 11).  I would like to see Common Access Card support.  Still, it will be my back up.
opera~~~1293062961~~~Transitman~~~5~~~This is my default browser. It serves my purposes as well as or better than Firefox or the Linux based browsers.
opera~~~1293305837~~~yslandro~~~5~~~The best there is! I may try other browsers, but I always return to Opera. Reasons: keyboard shortcuts, multiple tabs (great for research), e-mail handling, speed, configurability, spatial navigation, +++. Marvellous piece of software :-)

opera~~~1295372104~~~Goden~~~5~~~Superb brower. Since my laptop is not a speed-machine, I needed something that was light and fast. Opera fits the bill perfectly.

opera~~~1296994386~~~slackjp~~~5~~~Fast. Safe. Clean, And it allows to sync my 800+ favorites (and notes) between mac, linux, windows and phones. I also use FF3+sync but just for zotero an awesome bibliography plug-in tool (FF only). Catalan language: I did an unofficial translation 4 years ago (my.opera.com/quim), now a bit outdated

opera~~~1299800034~~~Inoki~~~2~~~Though Opera was always the leader in innovation and implementing the most versatile and essential features being incorporated into their products, all of them seem to be constantly in Beta stage, which I find very unpleasant. Their browser is equipped with what you will always need but all those features need development and lack full functionality since early stages, though have always been a great source of inspiration for customizers and competitors alike.

opera~~~1311352378~~~peileppe~~~2~~~Opera isn't very friendly on LinuxMint - looks ugly and is fat. There is an agreement box to accept first, something you don't see often on Linux

opera~~~1312120963~~~rexibit~~~4~~~For those using v11.10 of Opera for Mint and giving the low-star ratings due to it being clunky and having a bad interface, there's a much-improved v11.50 that's very clean and well-designed on Opera's website. So the repo needs to be updated. I'd give Opera a 5/5 if they fixed the opera drop-down-menu on the top-left to make it more user-friendly. It's still a pain to navigate and update settings.

opera~~~1314919596~~~dsfairplaine~~~5~~~Best browser out there!

opera~~~1316428830~~~Lasse74~~~4~~~A nice browser!
opera~~~1318420269~~~trollboy~~~4~~~I have revised my opinion of Opera upwards since using the latest version from their website. With an ad block extension and a javascript blocking extension it is a much better experience. And good grief it's fast! It may even replace Firefox as my default browser. Well, after a few weeks, Firefox still feels like home.

opera~~~1318829459~~~MrLinuxMint~~~5~~~It's the top web browser around. And that's the bottom line because usability, flow and an overall browsing experience say so¡
opera~~~1319545889~~~sunewbie~~~5~~~Primary browser, feature rich, using since opera 6.1. Like features such as notes, speed dial, sync, feed reader. Opera for Linux is much better , speedy, more stable and does not freeze on startup, and closes smoothly and completely unlike Windows version 11.51.
opera~~~1319483622~~~nicabod~~~4~~~Have been using ver. 10.63 until recently; however, too many pages didn't render correctly. Hoping latest will work better. E-mail up thru ver. 10.63 was very much a love/hate affair. Hope this will be better, too. Nevertheless, has many features that I prefer to Firefox, but I also use Ffx when pages act goofy in Opera. Problem is not Opera's -- it's Web designers who don't care a fig about standards -- if their pages work OK in Ffx, they're done designing and coding. I prefer Ffx add-ons/extensions, such as Babelfish for translation, and Downthemall!. Opera is really good regarding security and authentication.

opera~~~1319943914~~~ttmrichter~~~3~~~As a browser it's great and would be my choice of browser but for one slight problem: the company steadfastly refuses to support SOCKS5 proxies so the package is 100% useless to me, seeing as I use a SOCKS5 proxy to circumvent China's so-called Great Firewall™.

opera~~~1321855704~~~masoomi~~~5~~~With Opera running on your system, you won't need any extra apps to gather your mail, collect your feeds, save your notes, and keep your bookmarks safe and at your finger tips wherever you go or whatever machine or OS you run.
opera~~~1322051168~~~TitusX~~~5~~~The most complete browser out-of-the-box. You don't need to think about plugins or themes. Just use it. Cool is for example the syncing notes.

opera~~~1322212935~~~CtrlAltDel~~~3~~~Used to absolutely love Opera and I felt like it kind of belonged to me alone, since I had been using it for so many years.  Unfortunately, I got a computer screen with 1920x1080 resolution and Opera just can't seem to get the line-height correct.  I up the font size, so that I can see the font on the higher resolution screen, and paragraphs are jumbled and look horrible.  It's a bug that they can't seem to fix.

pcmanfm~~~1300884602~~~m4daredsun~~~5~~~I use it with the Openbox window manager and everything works perfectly. It's a really amazing file manager and incredibly lightweight

phpgroupware~~~1269713732~~~ddalley~~~3~~~Although this groupware was updated recently, it has a slow development rate and only a few developers, so I avoided this one. That should far outweigh any other advantages it may have, so I will give it a neutral score.
phpmyadmin~~~1274354323~~~Felagund~~~4~~~Very useful addition to your LAMP environment / très utile en complément d'un environnement LAMP.

picard~~~1281185378~~~darthanubis~~~5~~~Beautiful!
picard~~~1283010224~~~dequire~~~4~~~Great if you have mainly albums in your collection. Not so great if you mainly buy and download single tracks.
picard~~~1307242128~~~jajodo~~~2~~~No luck with this.  Do much better with EasyTag and Ex Falso
picard~~~1307316315~~~MrBig~~~2~~~prefer easy tag
picard~~~1309089361~~~jose_r~~~5~~~Great!
picard~~~1321658384~~~ianare~~~5~~~Works for me!
picasa~~~1267751570~~~GhoS~~~4~~~Really nice organizational software for photos, just the Linux verrsion a step behind the Windows one
picasa~~~1267791958~~~taricate~~~3~~~One more + for Picasa... but still is way behind other similar software
picasa~~~1271057019~~~Alexio~~~4~~~The smart way to manage your digital photo collection!
picasa~~~1271023554~~~clem~~~2~~~Great software. Works on Linux. Not made for Linux though and it's quite obvious. Terrible integration with the desktop.
picasa~~~1292110722~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~:) Picasa is a great photo manage and editor. The only thing I dislike about it is the HUGE databases it creates.
picasa~~~1273153930~~~mikew57~~~4~~~Good functionality but no longer updated for linux.
picasa~~~1273237120~~~kad3t~~~2~~~Doesn't do easily what I want it to do but does much more of what I don't care about. Wish it was more like FastStone Image Viewer...
picasa~~~1273470726~~~VICTOR360~~~1~~~I Love This On Windows But This Is Not For Linux This Is Running On Wine So Google We Want A Linux native Ver!
picasa~~~1274035594~~~bro3886~~~1~~~wine
picasa~~~1274387241~~~Danie~~~5~~~My all time favourite photo editor but pity it is not the latet version.
picasa~~~1274479574~~~hamburn~~~2~~~there are better apps for open source apps for that purpose
picasa~~~1274559399~~~kurko~~~5~~~Para mi, el mejor administrador de imágenes.
picasa~~~1274561332~~~jiminikiz~~~5~~~Can be installed from repositories. Essential.
picasa~~~1274809777~~~huntman~~~5~~~I Love this apps
picasa~~~1274903174~~~terravoice~~~4~~~very good mayby the best
picasa~~~1283151455~~~nikhilsinha~~~5~~~Best Photo Management software. Version 3.8 with face recognition is too good. Although v3.8 is windows only, but still it can be installed on ubuntu using the following tutotial URL - http://www.webupd8.org/2010/04/how-to-install-picasa-36-in-ubuntu.html
picasa~~~1275417924~~~Indyan~~~3~~~I wish it had the image viewer it's windows counterpart has.
picasa~~~1275955834~~~mauricep~~~4~~~Good photo manager. Good editing. So-so photo viewer. GREAT online sharing capabilities.
picasa~~~1276052635~~~qa_fan99~~~4~~~Not quite the same as the Win version but still a great photo library manager
picasa~~~1276632729~~~jajodo~~~4~~~I prefer gThumb but it is flaky when it comes to photo import.  Similar to with some advantages over F-Spot. None are perfect though and I wind up using all three for different capabilities.
picasa~~~1299846740~~~rob0917~~~5~~~comparable to windows live photo manager
picasa~~~1277752190~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Love this program, but wish there was a native Linux version instead of an old Windows version running on wine.
picasa~~~1277778831~~~xuduo~~~5~~~Go on! Hope it better!
picasa~~~1278220918~~~Viglim~~~2~~~Windows version with wine wrapper. I'm going to find something better.
picasa~~~1278431284~~~Richard~~~4~~~A quand la traduction de l'interface en Français ? Bon programme sinon pour un minimum et surtout à complèter d'un compte gmail afin de tirer parti de toutes ses fonctions
picasa~~~1279036364~~~bobd07~~~4~~~Great photo program.Not as in-depth as Gimp but easier to upload photos.
picasa~~~1279249455~~~Fuzzi99~~~4~~~it would be perfect if google actually made it a 100% linux package instead of bundling it as the windows version with wine wrapping.
picasa~~~1279608905~~~Dejmon~~~5~~~Výborný prohlíže?.
picasa~~~1280802383~~~drryu~~~4~~~Nice photo management app
picasa~~~1280952090~~~rahamohebbi~~~5~~~My favourite application.
picasa~~~1280977766~~~csmayfield~~~3~~~would have rated it 5, but this package is two years old; recommend installing latest version for windows via wine; unfortunately doesn't support video files under linux
picasa~~~1281271361~~~trastornao~~~4~~~Por desgracia funciona mejor en windows
picasa~~~1281544655~~~donald_duck~~~3~~~Y'a mieux
picasa~~~1281797126~~~prodrigu~~~4~~~good features
picasa~~~1281937023~~~deraltepowenz~~~5~~~it gives you an overview and is working fast
picasa~~~1290802330~~~rasmith1959~~~5~~~It's what every digital camera needs!
picasa~~~1283199812~~~ekeko~~~2~~~it uses wine, so non-western languages (like japanese,chinese, arabic) are not available for comments or watermarks... f-spot is much better!
picasa~~~1283361299~~~staffie~~~5~~~I love this
picasa~~~1283694227~~~vaatsaru~~~4~~~simple to use and publish albums, easy editing tools, decent photo management
picasa~~~1283849951~~~pelepedde~~~4~~~Easyest
picasa~~~1283907658~~~aibo~~~4~~~Works
picasa~~~1284092157~~~Hornito~~~5~~~Best free photo app on the net.
picasa~~~1284249927~~~akencito~~~4~~~Better than F-Spot
picasa~~~1284256461~~~Cougar~~~4~~~The best out of all the photo management software, that I've tried, at the moment unless you want to get Windows and get a commercial one like Photoshop Lightroom.  Havent tried Shotwell yet so I cant compare the two
picasa~~~1286187055~~~andriyr~~~3~~~looks like alien in gnome, though perfect on windows. looking for alternative :(
picasa~~~1286549613~~~shaon121~~~5~~~works great
picasa~~~1287609657~~~andrei~~~5~~~Not intuitive, but very fast UI and a lot of features
picasa~~~1287610121~~~cliste~~~5~~~I really like it, am running it under LMDE, and I think it's by far the best method of managing photos especially those that are for online display
picasa~~~1288305070~~~i-elf~~~5~~~Best of the no! I guarantee it!
picasa~~~1288448461~~~kreativeone~~~5~~~Goin' Google for everything! Best Feature: Especially like the ability to select specific folders and how they are updated (scan once, remove, scan always). Just as nice on Linux as on Windows...
picasa~~~1288559117~~~damien-tt~~~5~~~Very handy and simple. :)
picasa~~~1288608480~~~droc929~~~5~~~Esta muy bien, y es muy comoda y sencilla de usar. Un 10 para Google
picasa~~~1288940564~~~jesica~~~5~~~a must for photos
picasa~~~1289068982~~~happytazmania~~~5~~~Love it!
picasa~~~1290158288~~~resider~~~5~~~Ideal for photos
picasa~~~1290213167~~~johnnyp~~~3~~~a decent editor especially for people new to photo editing ... has some bugs , while trying to print 4x6 photos from the program  it tells your printer to roll the paper out to the last ince of the photo and then start printing  .... i dont have that problem with any other  programs while printing so i have to believe it's a picasa specifig bug
picasa~~~1290385000~~~Sol_Badguy~~~2~~~could be better --'
picasa~~~1296358211~~~killmess~~~4~~~Is the best easy and fast editor of all. It's emulated (wine) so is a little slow to start.
picasa~~~1290540339~~~caizu~~~5~~~Love it. <3
picasa~~~1291413366~~~Deadite81~~~3~~~Not bad.  I prefer Gthumb, as Picasa is big, keeps a huge database, and is a secret Wine user, so it looks ugly.
picasa~~~1291509715~~~IcILM~~~2~~~No face recognition, no geo tagging, Windows version alread on 3.8, runs its own Wine environment
picasa~~~1291658450~~~marksuci~~~4~~~Malo fali do savršenstva
picasa~~~1292431168~~~Goden~~~2~~~It uses a Wine wrapper, so it looks terrible. Not packaged for linux - would suggest using something else.
picasa~~~1294151146~~~Roku~~~4~~~I love picasa :) Good that there is also Linux version
picasa~~~1294243854~~~goranh~~~2~~~Could not open pictures on NTFS disk;
picasa~~~1294978125~~~akash211~~~4~~~This is better than default F-spot
picasa~~~1295177020~~~cybertriveni~~~5~~~gr8!
picasa~~~1295199033~~~Shostako~~~4~~~Picassa is a good software for your pics.
picasa~~~1295249111~~~pancaran~~~4~~~Good
picasa~~~1295410780~~~pascal~~~5~~~Perfect.
picasa~~~1295430824~~~Palden~~~4~~~This is my default photos manager
picasa~~~1295480219~~~jamesmvp~~~4~~~nice simple app, similar to iphoto on Mac
picasa~~~1295484680~~~grim~~~4~~~Good sauce.
picasa~~~1295721045~~~fcole90~~~5~~~Really fantastic photo organizer!
picasa~~~1295856954~~~tfriend0308~~~5~~~Love it! This is exactly what I was looking for!
picasa~~~1296415954~~~turtaf~~~1~~~crashes while loading my library. can't use it
picasa~~~1296416925~~~JeanGrosJean~~~2~~~Never liked it, even when I was on Windows. DigiKam is the best photo manager/organizer for Linux.
picasa~~~1296419538~~~wanda~~~3~~~Good ,but heavy.
picasa~~~1296422358~~~veloeric~~~5~~~+++
picasa~~~1296552963~~~freighter~~~5~~~very nice

picasa~~~1297142290~~~flan_suse~~~1~~~F-Spot and digiKam are better, and are native for Linux. Picasa devs are living under a rock... all these years, no native Linux port without wine? Give me a break.
picasa~~~1308606388~~~undiaoscuro~~~4~~~MUy bueno
picasa~~~1297695589~~~ashtoash~~~2~~~Heavy application! And still worked under Wine
picasa~~~1298256391~~~simmy~~~5~~~google supported wine projects and invested money towards their development, so the fact it uses a wine wrapper isnt out of laziness. Besides it outperforms native linux phot apps (for me) because it doesnt screw with my organized photos (f spot) or have a memory leak (shotwell) so ill happily use this in both windows and linux till native apps can do a better job.  my only issue, is the fact picasa backs up original pictures that youve touched up/edited, by use of ini files, which can beome clutter (wish they were hidden files like in windows)
picasa~~~1298288488~~~zaenal1234~~~3~~~is: heavy to run, and using wine, and also too deep in the scan images (all kinds of picture).
picasa~~~1299184805~~~billymadsen~~~4~~~great program. have to update it yourself  though
picasa~~~1299285692~~~Ioseph~~~1~~~This is run in wine.
picasa~~~1300916389~~~Dakal~~~1~~~wine sucks
picasa~~~1301074970~~~mitanshugamer~~~4~~~very good  program..
picasa~~~1301317472~~~sayan_acharjee~~~2~~~Not giving me the same experience as i felt while using it in windows...may be they need to update it :/
picasa~~~1301794577~~~millerjackr~~~5~~~best software hands down!
picasa~~~1302148260~~~madvins~~~4~~~good
picasa~~~1302533512~~~photomf~~~5~~~fantastic
picasa~~~1302558060~~~Homitsu~~~4~~~Good for simple operations.
picasa~~~1302645429~~~roguededguy~~~4~~~The best photo organizer with the most features that actually work. However, importing directly from a camera has never seemed to work, and results in freeze.
picasa~~~1302691203~~~owusuafriyie~~~4~~~good

picasa~~~1304181404~~~menta1789~~~5~~~ESTA PADRISIMO PARA ESTE TIPOS DE TRABAJOS
picasa~~~1304229091~~~pappas772~~~5~~~Top Merci.!!!!!!
picasa~~~1304320372~~~westmidsman~~~4~~~It has some great image editing features as well as organising picyures by date. It cannot import images directly from my canon camera so I have to transfer then manually to a folder then import them into Picasa from there. Picasa's GUI  does look like a throwback to wim95 at times!! Overall a nice package that keeps me organised with some powerful editing tools
picasa~~~1306077898~~~bittininja~~~4~~~ok for organizing photos
picasa~~~1306079149~~~turin13~~~3~~~It's great application, but not for Linux. Still lacks native support - you will use in a Wine.
picasa~~~1306110375~~~captcool~~~4~~~Runs under Wine but is the best organiser and does some very nice basic editing
picasa~~~1306522447~~~prasadkumar013~~~5~~~best organizer
picasa~~~1306605033~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~5~~~Wonderful photo organiser even though its not a native linux app

picasa~~~1307269512~~~900i~~~4~~~Don't use anything else, personally
picasa~~~1307284233~~~c1pr1an~~~5~~~very good for organizing photos
picasa~~~1307812992~~~jymn2005~~~5~~~Arguably the best tool
picasa~~~1308137792~~~obakfahad~~~5~~~Best best and obviously al.lltime best.........
picasa~~~1308100702~~~makruger~~~4~~~Best photo management app...but feels out of place in Linux. Needs better integration into the desktop
picasa~~~1309004391~~~DanLucier~~~2~~~Not native Linux. Might as well install Picasa 3.8 for Windows in Wine. I tried both. They both work for a while then froze and refused to repopen. Google shows no interest in porting native Linux versions. From Google: "If Picasa for Linux is successful, then other Google applications (and future versions of Picasa) may also be ported using Wine," (http://picasa.google.com/linux/faq.html#24).
picasa~~~1315795618~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~Highly over rated, would rather use Adobe Photoshop Express. At least I know it works because it is web based application. Plus i'm not a great fan of wine and when I tried Picasa it felt as though I was using Windows 3.11 again  OMG!
picasa~~~1309319041~~~avalosmau~~~5~~~Aplicación excelente
picasa~~~1310071337~~~lorcopotia~~~4~~~es muy bueno, la vdd!!!
picasa~~~1310586670~~~SeventhReign~~~5~~~Faster than most (ALL) native Linux image viewers.  Flawless integration.  It is perfect .. period
picasa~~~1310725638~~~linuxnpl~~~3~~~2*
picasa~~~1311369469~~~Tomas_IV~~~4~~~Not perfect, but does most common things you would need with photos and does it in simple and straightforward manner. When not enough, there are more capable specialized tools.
picasa~~~1312033202~~~pepo~~~4~~~Good software for manage album and quick edit. This release have only English language...
picasa~~~1312197163~~~RandyNose~~~3~~~It's ok, But if you're using Linux, why not a Native program? I can do most of what it does and more with native programs.  Don't care for WINE based programs, or it's Windows 95 look.
picasa~~~1312340522~~~cerm~~~3~~~bueno

picasa~~~1314962409~~~linuxali~~~4~~~4****
picasa~~~1315739597~~~Rufus~~~4~~~Very fast, has all features I need like presentation mode, Thunderbird e-mail integration and much more. One minor issue: sometimes pictures are displayed with artefacts.
picasa~~~1316881288~~~Kraft~~~4~~~I have works fine, no problem. Quickly and conveniently. Do not even feel that there is Wine.
picasa~~~1317069499~~~Anleoje~~~4~~~Awesome app! it's really impressive found it on Linux, but it use wine to work :(
picasa~~~1317596326~~~fenerbahce~~~5~~~5*****

picasa~~~1321931828~~~waltff~~~5~~~Love this program
pidgin~~~1271063785~~~Alexio~~~4~~~Better than most network-specific clients. You should know that the saved usernames and passwords are stored in a plain text file that anyone with access to your computer can read: see file:///home/YourUserName/.purple/accounts.xml
pidgin~~~1271090603~~~nikhilsinha~~~4~~~Very Useful.
pidgin~~~1272272629~~~unexistance~~~5~~~awesome cross-platform IM client. Even better if you install the facebook chat plugin (that's what people are now on nowadays)
pidgin~~~1272292598~~~KittyKatt~~~3~~~Awesome, awesome interface for multiple instant messaging protocols. I use it for pretty much everything. :D  NOTE: Don't forge to mention the Purple Plugin Pack in the Description for added functionality. ;)
pidgin~~~1272362590~~~clem~~~5~~~Must have.
pidgin~~~1273025854~~~Ainer~~~5~~~Super flexible, extensible, IM client. I've been running it since the early alpha days (back when it was even uglier and called Gaim) and it's a hard one to beat.
pidgin~~~1273499616~~~whaledove~~~5~~~I use it daily as my family all are using different IM
pidgin~~~1273597510~~~Rich_Roast~~~4~~~Best I've seen yet
pidgin~~~1274111241~~~pbmuk~~~4~~~I use this across several protocols. Very capable and easy to set up.
pidgin~~~1274308050~~~stephenmac7~~~3~~~It is okay
pidgin~~~1274532163~~~gr0ul~~~4~~~nice. but i want more then it has
pidgin~~~1274528519~~~hukoeth~~~5~~~One of the best multi protocol IM clients out there. Flexible through plug-in system and nice UI
pidgin~~~1274600609~~~exch~~~5~~~It's simple and clean. Just the way I like it!
pidgin~~~1289202731~~~Izumi~~~5~~~It's all I need for chating!
pidgin~~~1274862292~~~dragonias~~~5~~~Pidgin's ability to handle many protocols, as well as its extensibility trouhg plugins, makes it one of my most favourite IM clients =)
pidgin~~~1274871972~~~razernon~~~5~~~On of the best IM client for any platform.
pidgin~~~1275033158~~~linuxpenguin~~~5~~~I was skeptical at the beginning, but now I use it frequently - very good and you can be logged on multiple accounts at the same time
pidgin~~~1275128815~~~rappelkiste_src~~~5~~~Unterstützt so gut wie alle Protokolle. Durch Plugin-System umfangreich erweiterbar.

pidgin~~~1276573847~~~frubba~~~3~~~Very basic and smooth. Less points for lacking webcam support
pidgin~~~1276867615~~~acpcalin~~~4~~~Great messenger! I don't really use messengers, but when I do, this is the way to go.
pidgin~~~1276923765~~~khai~~~3~~~Poor Linux implementation of the full Win version
pidgin~~~1276924880~~~ikey~~~3~~~Very usable when other alternatives aren't accessible, also Pidgin is not a linux implementation of a Windows version, but the other way around. Pidgin was written on Linux originally and was named GAIM.
pidgin~~~1277117212~~~CeleronD~~~5~~~makes life easier for IM
pidgin~~~1277213927~~~davidy~~~5~~~The Best!
pidgin~~~1277482655~~~jperez~~~5~~~Works well and has a lot of functions not present in other IM apps.  Would still like to see Photo Sharing added for MSN.

pidgin~~~1279825744~~~jelnikar~~~5~~~Ein verdammt gutes Programm!
pidgin~~~1280623104~~~brianji03~~~5~~~This is my favorite instant messanging client. Much better than empathy in my opinion.
pidgin~~~1281677016~~~dbpatankar~~~3~~~Good one....... Just lacking video support.....
pidgin~~~1281848883~~~Squirrel~~~5~~~Pidgin is the GNU of chat clients. Yes, it does everything. Yes, it's free. Yes, it's easy to use. No, we still can not seem to get the word out.
pidgin~~~1311875967~~~sigurd1701~~~5~~~simple, easy to use yet powerful and ONE for all messenger protocols and Accounts! use it parallel to Empathy
pidgin~~~1282413684~~~incogita~~~4~~~Beautifully clean interface, and easily the number one IM client if you use multiple IM accounts. The lack of support for video and microphone conversations is probably it's biggest downfall. Apart from the support for multiple IM systems, the plugins are a good reason to use Pidgin over other IM clients.
pidgin~~~1282419291~~~ayonkhan~~~4~~~I like it.

pidgin~~~1297216249~~~cmaew04~~~3~~~Works great for what it is suppose to. I am not able to use the advanced features that the original programs would offer. Would rather have Yahoo Messenger than logging into Yahoo from Pidgin.
pidgin~~~1297381913~~~Flaker~~~3~~~It is like the lowest common denominator for all the protocols. I'd be happy with one 100% supported.
pidgin~~~1297593059~~~mudslinger~~~5~~~while it can be buggy with some protocols - it gives a nice simple interface without all of the flashy bits.

pidgin-skype~~~1304704302~~~mikefreeman~~~2~~~If you have to have Skype running at the same time anyway, you might as well just use Skype. When I tried it, Pidgin and Skype seemed to intefere with each other, and I could only use it effectively when I was using Skype by itself.
pidgin-skype~~~1322157906~~~groovydaddy~~~4~~~Very convenient.  I like the option of having my Skype with my other chat accounts.  Cool.

pingus~~~1282450393~~~tomdiana~~~5~~~Great clone!
pingus~~~1284582319~~~ozos~~~3~~~simple and fun game

pino~~~1273463615~~~justin~~~4~~~Pino is nice Twitter client which does the job right.  It is lacking some features like being able to view profiles directly in the client such as Tweetdeck, and some others as well.  Scored a 4 because of this.  If you need a simple Twitter client, this is a great one!
pino~~~1274310855~~~tonsil~~~5~~~A very nice twitter client.
pino~~~1277022124~~~thebrix~~~5~~~Much faster than gwibber and takes up less space on screen. Perfect for netbooks.
pino~~~1277393811~~~RandyNose~~~4~~~Woks ok, but doesn't support multiple streams like Gwibber or Choqok do. BUT it doesn't muddle out like Gwibber when it updates.
pino~~~1281082329~~~filosofem666~~~5~~~The best native Twitter client on Linux, if you don't care for multiple streams.
pino~~~1282687852~~~dme3ha~~~4~~~simple client for viewing your timeline. wish for a smaller font size tough
pino~~~1282697501~~~simons~~~3~~~Does Pino actually exist hete - I just get an "unknown URL" error .... ????

pitivi~~~1306523984~~~prasadkumar013~~~5~~~superb free software
pitivi~~~1309965895~~~ajan~~~1~~~Too basic. Even such a simple thing to combine a series of frames in a video requires lot of effort. Although it has only 3-4 commands, the way it is organized makes it hard to use.
pitivi~~~1310733182~~~linuxnpl~~~4~~~3*
pitivi~~~1316218358~~~newrave~~~1~~~Stürzt bei mir ständig ab und ist so funktional wie ein Milchbrötchen. Aber irgendwann...

pitivi~~~1319873928~~~Emil89~~~4~~~It's very basic, but it's the only one I've found where I can change the volume and opacity WITHIN a clip, rather than just between clips.
pitivi~~~1322195287~~~PocketSam~~~5~~~A basic app to work with video.
pktstat~~~1299528264~~~hexram~~~4~~~Real-time display of active network connections. Not for novice use.
planets~~~1304363706~~~Xyie~~~4~~~It's a fun program to play around with, but the tools aren't great for a solid understanding of the mechanics behind what you're doing - or they're not completely clear on them. Anyhow it's very fun to try and build star systems with it, you can get some nice and/or complex orbits going!
planets~~~1314004529~~~linux1492~~~4~~~Nice toy! The controls are very simple and perhaps not user friendly. But it is fun to play with gravity for some time. From the point of learning some physics one has to say that it is not more than a nice to play with tool. But playing is important for learning. So over all I like it!
planets~~~1319554867~~~garrett~~~5~~~Fun and more adictive than you may think.
planner~~~1293013479~~~Rafson~~~4~~~probably the best project management tool for GNOME :)

prelink~~~1291251098~~~mido~~~5~~~Very good. I use "prelink -amfR". Simple and fast
preload~~~1276552383~~~Rovanion~~~5~~~This is a smart program that will load the applications you use the most and the resources you are most likely to use in the near future into your RAM so that it doesn't have to be read from the hard drive when you need it.

prism-google-docs~~~1279249964~~~Fuzzi99~~~4~~~Google docs is the best office replacment if you have broadband. but mozilla prism isn't good compared to chrome's add app shortcuts.

pspp~~~1279801528~~~ivanovnegro~~~4~~~For me the replacement of SPSS. Makes the same things but doesnt everything.
pspp~~~1297876263~~~renoon~~~5~~~Does most basic statistics that someone like a student would need to do on large datasets like crosstabs, t-tests, regression, etc. Runs and reads SPSS data, but community needs more people to add more advanced statistical routines.

pwgen~~~1289696395~~~loweryaustin~~~1~~~TERRIBLE, I installed it and now its hiding like malware or something. On top of being errily hard to find and unusable, there is no way to contact the developer for help  or support. again TERRIBLE
pwgen~~~1320955239~~~yggryx~~~5~~~This is great for generating random passwords that you can pronounce. To uninstall, just go into the Software Manager or type "apt-get remove pwgen" in a console.
pybliographer~~~1274800996~~~farnaby~~~4~~~Nice and simple BibTeX editor. Support for some more formats would be very useful though.

pymol~~~1310114131~~~jose_r~~~5~~~Very powerful program for the visualization and modeling of protein structures or other molecules in general. It makes beatiful images and movies with the internal raytracer.
pyneighborhood~~~1278333983~~~galen~~~2~~~never seems to integrate with mint, tried many machines
pyneighborhood~~~1278334551~~~ibm450~~~2~~~never worked for me either
pyneighborhood~~~1279111162~~~Riao~~~4~~~took a while for me to get working but once I did it's quite nice. I had to make the mount folder within my home dir, and launch it as sudo via the terminal.
pyneighborhood~~~1296458783~~~Troposa~~~4~~~Great under Mint9xfce
pyneighborhood~~~1306925295~~~tmfk626~~~1~~~It would gbe a good program if it worked. Seems like some other folks are having less difficulty with it than me,

pyrenamer~~~1294684755~~~hellangel~~~5~~~its really great ! u must have
pyrenamer~~~1295091752~~~Qruqs~~~4~~~It works well for its intended use. However, it suffers from speed related issues when renaming many files. I also would like to see a directory renaming feature.
pyrenamer~~~1297703575~~~orion8~~~4~~~I've used krename for years, but pyrenamer is a great (and lighter) utility for my needs (renaming tons of photos).
pyrenamer~~~1302384521~~~Germmare~~~5~~~cool !
pyrenamer~~~1307264954~~~RavS~~~4~~~Does the job. And does it good.

pyrenamer~~~1319790888~~~cirx~~~3~~~Nice Interface; preview could be intelligenter; getting a bit slow in bigger directories
pyroom~~~1273698210~~~Sokkratez~~~5~~~Pyroom is the best (free) distraction-free text editor I've used on either Linux or Windows (though Q10 comes close on Windows). It has the basic features that I want (font options, auto-save, auto-indent), but the flexible theme editor is what sets Pyroom apart for me.
pyroom~~~1275939088~~~changke~~~4~~~the best under linux
pyroom~~~1278454295~~~zalesthebard~~~5~~~perfect to avoid distraction
pyroom~~~1280130157~~~brainiac~~~5~~~Excellent. Great for productivity for writers.

pyroom~~~1301429988~~~maxmir~~~5~~~Love pyroom when I just want to get things down on paper - er, screen - without distraction, which let's face it is what it says it'll do.
pyroom~~~1311940359~~~RavS~~~5~~~Started using this some time before. Now can't live without it! If u are a writer, this is a must try!
pyroom~~~1318198068~~~drackmere~~~5~~~Cross platform applications are very important to me.  Pyroom doest the exact same thing as Writeroom on OS X does.  Distraction free, simple, and elegant.  Great program for just getting down and writing.
pyroom~~~1321902588~~~chassum~~~4~~~If a blank sheet of paper is your worst enemy, then pyroom is your best friend!

pysdm~~~1281578551~~~thx1138~~~5~~~Das Proggie bietet die einfachste Lösung, um mit einer grafischen Oberfläche Partitionen und Festplatten dauerhaft einbinden zu können. Unglaublich, dass es nicht in der LM-Standardinstallation vorhanden ist.

python~~~1312652556~~~noman~~~5~~~More fun than people should be allowed to have. I came to programming late in life, but now hardly a day goes by without a little Python scripting to fix or automate something. Great first language to get a grasp on fundamentals, before you try a language that's less forgiving.

python-matplotlib~~~1286705055~~~m4daredsun~~~5~~~The syntax may look a bit difficult in the very beginning. But once you get used to it, you can plot your data with infinite possibilities. I use matplotlib in my daily scientific work and it rocks!!!!
python-matplotlib~~~1290130692~~~hexram~~~5~~~Steep learning curve, but a significant lot of benefits awaits you at the far end.
python-matplotlib~~~1301566024~~~farnaby~~~5~~~Powerful plotting tool and not really hard to learn. Combine it with ipython. It becomes really powerful if you know a bit of python, but you can start even without.
python-matplotlib~~~1303511371~~~ke7mbz~~~3~~~Well I spent a couple hours trying to figure out why the plotted value and the calculated value were so different. I kept changing the resolution, but no dice. Finally, I copied the code into MATLAB, with a few syntax changes, and ran it. Boom, right answer. Sure it's a little harder to learn than MATLAB, but I figured it would be worth it. It doesn't matter what it costs or how powerful it is, in scientific computing if it's not accurate it's useless. Very disappointed. Especially considering the effort I'd already put into learning it. In my opinion, scientific computing in Python is still a bit mickey mouse. But if your time's not worth anything to you, and you want a skill that no employer's looking for, go for it.
python-matplotlib~~~1304902182~~~terces~~~5~~~I prefer this over all commercial alternatives.
python-matplotlib~~~1308323417~~~georgetd~~~5~~~This is a wonderful set of tools.  If you aldeady know python and Matlab learning this is a breaze, the syntax is very similar.  The resulting plots are publication quality, suport of LaTeX fonts is very good, and the plots are easy to script so that making small changes months after you produce the original is easy.  I have never had any issues with the plots being inaccurate.

qbittorrent~~~1283048706~~~UnityXPeaceXEquality~~~5~~~"Hmm... Woah... Wow... WOW!" - My reaction.  I began to download a large torrent file on Transmission, and noticed it's speed wasn't exactly up to par.  So, I did my research, and came across this powerhouse.  I plugged in my torrent (this is with no setup, aside from putting in the correct port) and I got up to 1.2MB/s within 10 seconds!  That's better the uTorrent on my Windows box!
qbittorrent~~~1283048915~~~danstinebaugh~~~5~~~Love It!

qbittorrent~~~1299906699~~~hysan~~~5~~~I've tried both Transmission, Deluge, and qBittorrent. Of the three, qBittorrent has the cleanest interface and is the easiest to use. For anyone else coming over from uTorrent, this will feel the most familiar.

qbittorrent~~~1317837985~~~mitanshugamer~~~2~~~Not to good. Clearly can better have font adjustment. simple client like others but tries to resemble utorrent. that's why I'm not a fan...
qbittorrent~~~1321618471~~~Oerot~~~5~~~I use this client over others for the fabulous RSS downloader.
qbittorrent~~~1321690723~~~sabaya~~~5~~~Mark my words, this is going to replace Transmission as the default torrent in a few years.

quodlibet~~~1278800281~~~Twiguard~~~4~~~One of the many great audio players for Linux. I don't use it much though.
quodlibet~~~1280561610~~~Inoki~~~5~~~This definitely is the player of choice. If you haven't been using an explorer-like player before, now is the time. You'll be amazed how intuitive it is and you'll get used to its features very quickly. It is the best way to manage your music all in one place. Explorer type players are the best option for simple reasons - they make your life very easy. You don't have to create playlists, save them, browse for files, you got everything in one place. One feature I'd suggest though is to implement a folder erase option within the player.
quodlibet~~~1282342765~~~ivanovnegro~~~3~~~Not bad but can not use it with a big music library. I have to admit Im addicted to the Guayadeque Music Player.
quodlibet~~~1293167658~~~JeanGrosJean~~~5~~~My music player of choice. Not bloated like other music players with all sorts of gimmicks. Just does the job a music player should do: acces to your music folder and playing the music.
quodlibet~~~1298482717~~~najo~~~5~~~At last I've found a program that suits all my needs. With a little bit of custom tags it let's me execute a query like 'all jazz since 1955 with tenor saxophone on it'. Awesome. And writing your own plugins has never been easier, since quodlibet is written in python!
quodlibet~~~1301207809~~~k273~~~3~~~It installed also programs I didn't want, even which I'd uninstalled. The concept of one-stop audio library organizer and stuff is commendable, though. Lightweight. But no equalizer is a dealbreaker.
quodlibet~~~1304743111~~~madshad~~~5~~~great with large collections
quodlibet~~~1318988015~~~krelverehan~~~5~~~Simply the best music player for linux. Handles my +1000 album library with ease. Aimed towards the user looking for a simple yet powerful alternative to all the itunes-esque players out there.

r-base~~~1303063090~~~deltaexplorer~~~3~~~There is a very nice GUI for R, it is RKWard. And in case someone is interested there is one for Octave:  QtOctave. I found therm in the Software Manager.
r-base-core~~~1272468556~~~Alexio~~~4~~~A statistics program that can do much much more, it is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories.

rabbitvcs-core~~~1314194921~~~carlosjimy~~~5~~~Excelente gestor para SVN. Muy similar a Tortoise.

rabbitvcs-nautilus~~~1298565386~~~DashW~~~2~~~Soooo slow! Found myself having to remove it almost immediately. Apparently a lot of work is still being done to improve performance. I would say wait for the project to mature a little.

rabbitvcs-nautilus~~~1317068141~~~bblonski~~~3~~~OK for small repos, but chokes on large ones.  Details here: http://blog.rabbitvcs.org/archives/164.  I use pagavcs instead.  It's a similar TortoiseSVN clone, but doesn't choke like RabbitVCS.  Although it doesn't have quite as many features and isn't as mature.

Not very friendly for "newbies", and a lot more work than is really necessary, even for more experienced users.

rdesktop~~~1317981229~~~fgr1986~~~5~~~Really usefull
rdiff-backup~~~1317065952~~~bblonski~~~5~~~Best backup software I've used.  Unencrypted mirrors, reverse incrementals, minimized disk usage, and extremely efficient bandwidth usage.  However, no gui.  Backups take less disk space and bandwidth than rsync, but more CPU so it might be slower.  Use rsync if you are CPU bound and have plenty of storage space.  Also check out duplicity if you need encryption.

Before a forum or blog post, I write with RNB and so I always have an updated and indexed back-up of all my texts.  The software is very good and works well with Dropbox. The content formatting tools are a bit poor [reason for 4 stars instead of 5] but sufficient for everyday operations. It is available for Linux, Mac and Win.

rhythmbox~~~1267840993~~~mmesantos1~~~5~~~Features are exactly what I need, does the job very well. Best music player I have used in linux so far.
rhythmbox~~~1268009554~~~conquerortim~~~5~~~Excellent program for music organisation and playing. Could be slightly lighter weight, otherwise perfect.
rhythmbox~~~1268076018~~~ddalley~~~4~~~I use this mainly for listening to free Internet Radio stations. It is one of the two such programs that I'be been able to use for this. My music remains unorganised...
rhythmbox~~~1271280377~~~Mdyter~~~5~~~Rhythmbox is one of my favorite music players. update it to last version (avaible from ppa) and enjoy
rhythmbox~~~1271280901~~~Teucca~~~4~~~basic player
rhythmbox~~~1271365125~~~kunk~~~4~~~Nicely organizes one's music library.
rhythmbox~~~1271591983~~~MintHat~~~5~~~Love this program, I use it for all my music.
rhythmbox~~~1273310639~~~caje~~~3~~~Could be better, I prefer Exaile.
rhythmbox~~~1274264158~~~darkprof~~~2~~~This program does not work with the Russian character sets (though as if the properties of dwarf - audio press in the name of any nonsense)
rhythmbox~~~1274287793~~~robertochile87~~~3~~~buenos plugins
rhythmbox~~~1274561398~~~jiminikiz~~~4~~~I wish this player had the following built-in: EQ, proper crossfade, global hotkeys. Otherwise, one of the best Gnome media players.
rhythmbox~~~1274800709~~~farnaby~~~3~~~No bad software, but has some flaws. I prefer banshee.
rhythmbox~~~1274837530~~~spayk~~~4~~~A bit basic, but still a nice and easy to use music player.
rhythmbox~~~1274891206~~~skretzchy~~~5~~~good music player, use it for my samsung mp3-player and mobilephone
rhythmbox~~~1275128922~~~rappelkiste_src~~~4~~~Einfacher Musikplayer, umfangreich erweiterbar duch Plugins.
rhythmbox~~~1275135056~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~I like it, but as an old Winamp user I'm still looking for an application similar to the old XMMS. I'm more into lighter user interfaces that just play my stuff and sit tightly in the system tray while I enjoy my work. Rhythmbox is not light at all but at least it's good.
rhythmbox~~~1275310214~~~RandyNose~~~4~~~I like it. It's useable, but it's not WinAmp or the pre KDE 4 Amarok that I knew and loved.   BUT the Built in support for Sharing the Music on the network is great, and I'm able to share Music Libraries with all the households computers.  Brilliant!  Enjoy the Streaming from the internet Radio Stations as well. (Could use a better list, tho'). All in All, a Really GOOD program.
rhythmbox~~~1275509172~~~crom~~~2~~~I had problems with this one and find it a little confusing. My choice is Exaile.
rhythmbox~~~1275819547~~~begrebela~~~4~~~Finds new music automatically and the layout is clear. Sometimes it shows the wrong title.
rhythmbox~~~1275969301~~~rainserpent~~~4~~~It has its bugs, but I am slowly warming up to it.
rhythmbox~~~1304802248~~~JoSch~~~2~~~i prefer banshee. very similar but more functional
rhythmbox~~~1276129269~~~SeanBest~~~4~~~Nice simple easy to use music player. Like a few others, but use this as my default.
rhythmbox~~~1276564917~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Decent iTunes alternative, especially with the Ubuntu store plugin added in.
rhythmbox~~~1276569751~~~frubba~~~4~~~Pretty straight forward music player. Did exactly what I expected it to do.
rhythmbox~~~1276908104~~~aneurysm1985~~~3~~~Reviewing version 0.12.8: I have spent a lot of time trying to find a music player that does everything I want - similar to Winamp on the PC. The one unforgivable thing that I don't like about Rhythmbox is the way that songs are automatically deleted from the play queue. This is an easily fixed problem that should be rectified, as I like to set up temporary playlists and revisit them multiple times before eventually clearing tracks from the playlist. The back end of Rhyhmbox seems OK, but this feature is the deal-breaker for me. A skinnable interface would also be welcome, as the current 'block' appearance is quite unappealing to me. I'm using Exaile instead.
rhythmbox~~~1277411012~~~Twiguard~~~5~~~I thing I tried all the audio players out there but this is the winner.
rhythmbox~~~1277980974~~~dme3ha~~~5~~~works out of the box (of Isadora), detected my iPod, usefull for audio podcast, last.fm..works great
rhythmbox~~~1278316512~~~robertofmj~~~4~~~Very simple, and easy to use. Need more stability to hash mp3 libraries over 200 gigabites.
rhythmbox~~~1278454127~~~zalesthebard~~~4~~~basically itunes
rhythmbox~~~1278587235~~~alexnat~~~2~~~fades to black often.
rhythmbox~~~1279422205~~~mtnbiker72~~~2~~~Not good...unreliable cd ripping, spotty music transfers to my Sansa, and it crashes. Terrible choice for the default player on Linux Mint
rhythmbox~~~1279608676~~~Dejmon~~~5~~~Není co dodat, velice dobrý!
rhythmbox~~~1280321257~~~ivanovnegro~~~2~~~Not bad but buggy on my machine and too slow for large music libraries.
rhythmbox~~~1295177268~~~cybertriveni~~~4~~~gr8
rhythmbox~~~1280623030~~~brianji03~~~5~~~Works great with libimobiledevice. I thought I would never be able to use my iDevice with linux. Rhythmbox is very fast and simple. Much better than iTunes for windows.
rhythmbox~~~1311877175~~~sigurd1701~~~5~~~simple and powerful, missing cd-rip / import media tool like soundjuicer
rhythmbox~~~1282413857~~~incogita~~~4~~~Very fast, very simple, and with plenty of features and plugins. The last.fm access is a wonderful feature, allowing you to discover new music for free. Works well with the iPod, and is frankly better than iTunes. Also supports access to music stores.
rhythmbox~~~1282660338~~~Zethy~~~5~~~So far this is one of the best music players I've encountered. This is a good choise if you need fast music search and immediate detection of new music in your library.
rhythmbox~~~1282668520~~~mocito_feliz~~~5~~~YEAH¡¡¡¡
rhythmbox~~~1290788436~~~wanda~~~2~~~Nicht mehr mein gesmack na das ich Audacious entdeckt hab.
rhythmbox~~~1283235626~~~yochiwarez~~~2~~~yo les recomiendo..clementine , es aun mas simple
rhythmbox~~~1283379563~~~Squirrel~~~5~~~It opens more formats than competing programs, and has the same features. RythmBox wraps all of this in a delightfully simple interface, and small system footprint.
rhythmbox~~~1283625764~~~jrunnels~~~5~~~works great, but not with my iPhone 4...
rhythmbox~~~1283771598~~~MathiusQuest~~~5~~~Rhythmbox has alsways been my Nr.1 since i stepped into the world of Linux. I tried a lot media/musicplayers but this one is really the best for me.
rhythmbox~~~1283907490~~~aibo~~~3~~~Works, but never seems to work quite right.  Still looking for a decent clean, simple, functional linux music player.
rhythmbox~~~1283936086~~~adirusf~~~4~~~Its a great player sometimes have some issue when i change the music a cracking sound in spite of that is fast simple
rhythmbox~~~1284409599~~~shwany~~~5~~~my all time favourite, well neck and neck with vlc
rhythmbox~~~1284409620~~~joe1~~~2~~~doesn't save song info easily and I'm not able to rip cdees without it hogging all my system resources
rhythmbox~~~1284427472~~~ozos~~~4~~~Good and simple, my default music player
rhythmbox~~~1284769897~~~anguyita~~~4~~~pero la visualizacion solo funciona una en las demas cuando cambias se cuelga
rhythmbox~~~1285688613~~~Said~~~3~~~Works perfectly on my PC but keeps crashing on my (new) netbook...
rhythmbox~~~1286157824~~~speedfire~~~3~~~Gere bien les medias, et ouvre les peripheriques amovible (ce qui ne fonctionne pas totallement), aucun settings de son (equaliseur, DSP, stereo 3D, true bass...). Trop Old school a mon gout.
rhythmbox~~~1287174839~~~dazw2000~~~4~~~Simple to use,great visuals,and some top radio stations built in.
rhythmbox~~~1287488757~~~jesica~~~3~~~very easy to use
rhythmbox~~~1287792300~~~Xendon~~~3~~~A good Player but to slow and sometimes confusing.
rhythmbox~~~1287823324~~~tamoghna4~~~2~~~Try Amarok guys, you'll forget everything!
rhythmbox~~~1288080409~~~zubatac~~~3~~~no sync device
rhythmbox~~~1288100761~~~Deadite81~~~3~~~Pretty good music player, I use it often.  It lacks a file browser, which is a huge downfall.  It can be testy with file types that other players read easily even though they're always saying things like "It uses the same backend" and whatnot.  Just be sure to install Clementine or Deadbeef for an easy access player for files you don't want in your "library", like audio books.
rhythmbox~~~1288201868~~~jessie0514~~~5~~~Nice music player.
rhythmbox~~~1291514939~~~Sol_Badguy~~~4~~~Good and simple :)
rhythmbox~~~1288751875~~~A-reg~~~5~~~Desde que le instalé el EQ no lo cambio, tiene un excelente sonido
rhythmbox~~~1289936255~~~H4x0r18~~~5~~~I like this more than iTunes! It works for every mp3 player device I've plugged in and it organizes music playlists and even radio stations! Best ever.
rhythmbox~~~1290015827~~~peileppe~~~5~~~nice and easy (come preinstalled)
rhythmbox~~~1290020466~~~Jac978~~~4~~~Very good music player and well integrated into the system
rhythmbox~~~1290056736~~~anandkumar44~~~5~~~It is the best music player for linux mint I am just loving it
rhythmbox~~~1290362649~~~mcduarte2000~~~3~~~Its ok, but Banshee is much better.
rhythmbox~~~1290380987~~~marcabishop~~~5~~~The best!
rhythmbox~~~1290792812~~~drum~~~2~~~Audacious is great much better than rhytmbox
rhythmbox~~~1303543828~~~guv999~~~4~~~Easy to use and stable.  Could improve with better metadata support and cover art etc  Works with my Creative Zen very well
rhythmbox~~~1291051824~~~tanjiasong~~~3~~~keeps crashing
rhythmbox~~~1292166655~~~ted1735~~~4~~~great and seemless plugandplay
rhythmbox~~~1292172988~~~Poweradmin~~~4~~~Nice music maneger like iTunes
rhythmbox~~~1292222072~~~Shostako~~~2~~~There are several music players better than this, in my opinion.
rhythmbox~~~1293544670~~~dhoca73~~~4~~~Works fine. Amarok don't work for me (I suppose cause I use Gnome)
rhythmbox~~~1293561778~~~fobenavi~~~1~~~Es un reproductor muy simple.
rhythmbox~~~1293628070~~~mm-iv~~~4~~~??????? ?????????? ????? winamp, ?? ????????;)
rhythmbox~~~1294048608~~~RobinJ~~~5~~~The only music player/organizer that has never yet failed me!
rhythmbox~~~1294195717~~~vioviocity~~~3~~~Its okay... gets the job done.
rhythmbox~~~1294198489~~~JeanGrosJean~~~2~~~Keeps freezing on me. Then, as with most other music players like Amarok or Banshee, it organizes my music for me, which I don't like, so I use QuodLibet, the best.
rhythmbox~~~1294241731~~~bunty-arnab~~~4~~~Nice Dedicated Music Player
rhythmbox~~~1294449229~~~grim~~~5~~~I use it everyday, lacks some minor features... but works smoothly!
rhythmbox~~~1294536979~~~ebest97~~~2~~~Ok but Banshee is better
rhythmbox~~~1294741570~~~noman2008~~~5~~~super player. but wher is equlizer.
rhythmbox~~~1294978081~~~akash211~~~5~~~I can't live without it on mint. I use it everytime on my laptop
rhythmbox~~~1295388781~~~mpkingsley~~~2~~~Two features that i miss from banshee are 1) gapless playback and 2) replay gain correction.  Very Simplistic gui, great for the casual user.
rhythmbox~~~1295758949~~~Timmythepirate~~~4~~~better than banshee
rhythmbox~~~1296959172~~~jajodo~~~4~~~Solid, simple.  Not as full featured as Banshee.  Does not sync android devices.
rhythmbox~~~1303312618~~~MintHerO~~~5~~~It is a nice media player, like the simple GUI. Love that it supports my media buttons :)
rhythmbox~~~1297217230~~~cmaew04~~~5~~~A better replacement for Windows Media Player. Organizes my songs well and does not have the overkill that Windows Media Player does..
rhythmbox~~~1297372231~~~goodspeed~~~4~~~my favourite media player
rhythmbox~~~1297381451~~~Flaker~~~3~~~does not support urls with m3u? maybe to basic at the moment.
rhythmbox~~~1298194443~~~ReckouNT~~~1~~~apt-get remove rhytmbox
rhythmbox~~~1298395815~~~CyruzWings~~~4~~~At least this player can play my favorites music
rhythmbox~~~1298477990~~~cMo2011~~~4~~~Works great, looks decent. My only grip would be that it doesn't auto-mount non-linux drives that have music added.
rhythmbox~~~1299281032~~~Ioseph~~~5~~~My choice OSS replacement for winamp.
rhythmbox~~~1300026001~~~anatolik2008~~~5~~~Really great player for Linux
rhythmbox~~~1301855483~~~bentinc~~~4~~~My favourite music player for Linux. It can do everything I need and it is faster than Banshee.
rhythmbox~~~1301914262~~~burjans~~~2~~~I think audacious is better
rhythmbox~~~1302004771~~~maxmir~~~2~~~Tries to do everything and fails. I prefer audacious and gpodder
rhythmbox~~~1302317500~~~dardevelin~~~4~~~very good program, if you install banshee you even have a sound quality gain on both
rhythmbox~~~1302349422~~~HATRED~~~5~~~When you close it, Click on the volume icon. There is << pause >> , Also on the volume icon if you click on sound preferences and applications youcan lower the volume of Rhythmbox or any other application that has sound
rhythmbox~~~1302345937~~~jimmyMaruchan~~~4~~~I don't know how to get the sound to stop playing when I close the program in GUI.  Without hitting the pause button first, that is.
rhythmbox~~~1303381798~~~vonvalley~~~3~~~i personally don't like it. try out clementine
rhythmbox~~~1303419388~~~groovydaddy~~~3~~~Simple app.  Good GUI.  Supports many types of media.  Does not have EQ or other features I would like to see.  I use VLC for almost all of my multimedia (music, movies, etc).
rhythmbox~~~1304024822~~~alextsr~~~2~~~Basic app. A bit outdated.
rhythmbox~~~1304026471~~~Ciprian~~~5~~~Awesome! But like alextsr says, is A bit outdated.
rhythmbox~~~1304031565~~~Ebenezer~~~4~~~Simple GUI, and does what i want - play my music. Not too bloated (i don't need sometimes misleading wikipedia entries or lyrics - if i want those, i can google them myself)
rhythmbox~~~1304179033~~~B_Tide~~~2~~~also prefer amarok under gnome!
rhythmbox~~~1305254403~~~akanashiro~~~3~~~it doesn't have equalizer!
rhythmbox~~~1305643467~~~jonna~~~4~~~I like banshee for the art alnum search

rhythmbox~~~1305758123~~~bulmaro90~~~4~~~Excelente reproductor de música
rhythmbox~~~1306333178~~~pfjap-paco~~~3~~~I prefer Amarok, Rhythmbox is just too simple for me.
rhythmbox~~~1306676582~~~alaak~~~5~~~Is able to play last.fm Radio
rhythmbox~~~1306676884~~~Mason-~~~2~~~I prefer Banshee, though they are similair it has better features, and it's just personal prefereance. Good music player, rather simple though.
rhythmbox~~~1307233721~~~gilnord~~~3~~~Je préfère Banshee car Rythmbox n'a pas d'égalisateur(equaliser)
rhythmbox~~~1307281919~~~Althorion~~~4~~~It has all the features I need. It could be faster, though...
rhythmbox~~~1307847505~~~dumsterdave~~~3~~~slow, limited features, but works
rhythmbox~~~1309160384~~~mitanshugamer~~~2~~~Holy crap. memory hog. Try gmusicbrowser instead..
rhythmbox~~~1308737115~~~gwaro~~~3~~~its fine but i prefer songbird
rhythmbox~~~1308909261~~~satishkc~~~4~~~Love it! Mostly just works & respects users' prefs much better
rhythmbox~~~1308954200~~~Andria~~~4~~~respect!
rhythmbox~~~1310130959~~~rocker~~~5~~~essential
rhythmbox~~~1310441727~~~SeventhReign~~~5~~~Its not my preferred player, but as there is nothing wrong with it and it works great I have to give it a 5.
rhythmbox~~~1310741937~~~galen~~~3~~~hog, daap server is unstable, good random playlist. Banshee is also buggy & more of a hog.
rhythmbox~~~1311565039~~~mdowden~~~3~~~Slow and locks up often, but I like the features.
rhythmbox~~~1311615130~~~tek_heretik~~~5~~~simpler and better than Amorok, etc.
rhythmbox~~~1311741020~~~pootman256~~~5~~~Fantastic media player. Simple, easy to add and maintain library, and smooth playing.
rhythmbox~~~1312562556~~~acoutinho~~~4~~~Great to listen to your music. Easy to use and simple.
rhythmbox~~~1312583735~~~SrMint~~~5~~~Pena que não vem mais por padrão no Mint :/ | Mas é um ótimo player.
rhythmbox~~~1313771592~~~Camille4000~~~5~~~Simple et agréable à utiliser + 5
rhythmbox~~~1313115696~~~Labby~~~3~~~It's not the greatest media player, but it does get the job done. I give it a "so so"!
rhythmbox~~~1313339002~~~taohansen~~~4~~~bom
rhythmbox~~~1314622120~~~MajorGrubert~~~2~~~Pas assez configurable et a du mal à scanner entièrement ma bibliothèque (12000 titres) sans planter
rhythmbox~~~1315646626~~~dragondave53~~~4~~~Crashes less than Banshee!
rhythmbox~~~1316998352~~~bentanic~~~5~~~Has a lot more plugins than Banshee and works just as well.
rhythmbox~~~1317157677~~~rogerporti~~~5~~~Simple, funcional y estable.
rhythmbox~~~1317299938~~~mparfitt~~~3~~~Anything's better than iTunes, but Banshee works best for me with music library on NFS.
rhythmbox~~~1317365883~~~Hil002~~~2~~~Prefiero Banshee!!! que si tiene EQ
rhythmbox~~~1317452898~~~Kraft~~~4~~~Works not bad, but there is no equalizer.
rhythmbox~~~1317457529~~~franzy952~~~3~~~banshee
rhythmbox~~~1317562476~~~ratedrampage~~~5~~~Crashes a lot less than Banshee and can handle a larger library.
rhythmbox~~~1317657330~~~augusto_mint~~~4~~~It's stable and gets the job done.
rhythmbox~~~1317693645~~~Anleoje~~~2~~~Prefiero Banshee 100% mejor! xD

ri-li~~~1284854464~~~emuse~~~5~~~Wonderfull twist on Snake! Graphics are fantastic! This is a great game for kids and adults alike. The developers have done an A+ job! Just a great fun free game!
ri-li~~~1287200690~~~PinkSombrero~~~4~~~Its a pretty game, and a nonboring twist on snake, as emuse pointed out. Pretty :)
ri-li~~~1287202193~~~mikefreeman~~~3~~~Fun game! I just don't quite get the quiz between each level. At least it's not something that people in the U.S. need to know, so it's more of an annoyance and detracts from the game. If there's a way to turn that feature off, change the subject of the questions, etc. it would be much better.
ri-li~~~1296594094~~~Jac978~~~4~~~Great Snake like game.

ripoff~~~1292578870~~~randomz~~~2~~~This tool just crashed for me in the middle of ripping. It doesn't seem to be in development any more, as this version is 3 years old.

ripperx~~~1275652175~~~CarstenD~~~4~~~the quality of the ripped songs is very good, it's a pity that only the first nine mp3-files get the according ID-tags and only the first nien files are listed within the created playlist
ripperx~~~1275666749~~~huntman~~~5~~~very good app.
ripperx~~~1277018257~~~kayalemao~~~4~~~great app, previous related restrictions are a pity but hopefully will be solved
ripperx~~~1293303657~~~LanceHaverkamp~~~1~~~Unusable: It says CD isn't inserted, & no configuration options for anything but mp3.
ripperx~~~1293478330~~~iry1989~~~2~~~says no cd inserted -> unusable
ripperx~~~1294823053~~~murmelbaer~~~3~~~I like it for ripping my audiocd and encode it in .ogg-Files. The GUI isn't really usable, but ripping and encoding  works.

ripperx~~~1301073599~~~Piilen~~~5~~~Works great, combine with the lame encoder to produce mp3's from cd's
ripperx~~~1307311561~~~jajodo~~~3~~~Less intuitive than sound juicer or asunder.  Could not immediately figure out how to encode as flac or ogg.  WAV and MP3 were obvious.  Gave up quickly.
ripperx~~~1309898509~~~vgstef~~~5~~~For me, it's easy and straigthforward. It's also the only one that found the correct song titles.

rosegarden~~~1290361674~~~aprilland~~~3~~~I'm afraid, it takes a lot of time and pain to make it work. It makes the system hang. It seems to conflict with PulseAudio. Alas! I prefer Tuxguitar, it performs no conflicts.
rosegarden~~~1292434702~~~EDDE_E~~~5~~~If you like GarageBand, well this is the app for you. It works great with jackd/alsa, not with pulseaudio(it hangs the system). One of the best out there.

rott~~~1281106867~~~dlkreations~~~4~~~This was one of the games that came out originally in 1994, and for me was better than DOOM. I loved the sense of humor from all the developers with their inclusion of their hidden easter eggs, and the fact that the gameplay was just awesome! For those who have the original game and are able to play it natively on Linux is a major plus!

sauerbraten~~~1271358740~~~kunk~~~5~~~Did not get to try out many modern shooters but this one I really liked. Graphics looks good. You can set all the effects and stuff. I think it is fun to play and the editor is great and easy to use.

sbackup~~~1268691116~~~Mdyter~~~4~~~a simple backup application, backups what and when you wont
sbackup~~~1274422913~~~alaak~~~4~~~Nice backup solution. Imho currently better than MintBackup. Only annoying problem: If my external drive is not mounted it creates backups locally and pollutes my local hard drive instead of failing silently.
sbackup~~~1276102423~~~jolouis32~~~5~~~Merveilleux
sbackup~~~1279097708~~~Liszt~~~1~~~Unfortunately does not work in latest version of Mint. Apparently a patch is available but I found Back In Time to be an excellent alternative
sbackup~~~1279619247~~~sanse~~~2~~~Indeed, does not work (Isadora Gnome x64). Installed it from the package manager and made configurations. Pressing the Backup Now! button creates another process and then it just sits there. Closing the GUI makes the created process vanish too.
sbackup~~~1285198755~~~rothgar~~~5~~~Dead simple, small install, and more features than mintBackup.
sbackup~~~1286122747~~~frodus~~~5~~~Perfect tool for backup by using SSH :)
sbackup~~~1291103059~~~AlkoLoiK~~~4~~~Very fast and indeed, quite simple. But il lacks some options to be perfect.
sbackup~~~1291732015~~~coronero~~~3~~~not exactly what i was looking for
sbackup~~~1292936887~~~murmelbaer~~~4~~~I restored the backup of my old files with sbackup (Simple backupsuite for desktopuse):  1. Old system: Linux Mint 9 Gnome; Backup with the Part >Simple Backup Config< of the sbackup-Suite.  2. Cleared the partitions 3. Installed new system  4. New system: Linux Mint 9 XFCE; Restore with the Part >simple Backup Restore => it worked very well!
sbackup~~~1298812440~~~kip-~~~5~~~this is better backup tool then dejadup! its very fast.. i dont missing encryption of my backups as i encrypt archives befor i upload them with this beautiful tool... it does have automatic backups as well and si simple even for my nontech person

Maybe working on compiling something, chatting over irssi, compressing some file to your webhotel with ssh access too and much much more.

scribus~~~1271057250~~~Alexio~~~4~~~It's great for desktop publishing, has quite the list of features and is fairly easy to get used to.
scribus~~~1271023749~~~clem~~~5~~~Excellent app.
scribus~~~1273066478~~~moorewarner~~~5~~~Scribus always gets added to new installs , should be a default. A great Desktop publishing app. Most folks don't realize how much easier it is to do layout work in a desktop publishing application as opposed to a word processor.
scribus~~~1274273714~~~tadatma~~~5~~~great application but not enough templates available
scribus~~~1274454587~~~Morgen~~~5~~~Learning curve that is well worth the time. Great app!
scribus~~~1274917850~~~Canid~~~4~~~Bom!!!
scribus~~~1319770027~~~Tasyo~~~5~~~Good replacement for Adobe's PageMaker and Microsoft's Publisher.  Version 1.3.9 (from GetDeb) is a nice improvement over the stock version from the repos.  Not being able to support .PMD or .PUB files shouldn't be an excuse not to use this software, since neither PageMaker nor Publisher don't even support Scribus' native file format, either.
scribus~~~1276563971~~~mikefreeman~~~5~~~Great!
scribus~~~1277411105~~~Twiguard~~~2~~~I don't get this app. Know some better DTP apps.
scribus~~~1279207178~~~Wamukota~~~4~~~Nice DTP once you get the hang of it. Documentation could be improved for a novice user

scribus~~~1294872933~~~Qruqs~~~4~~~Very nice program. Does things a bit out of the ordinary, but the end result is perfect.
scribus~~~1294884245~~~grim~~~4~~~Helped me a lot in the past :D Interface could be better though
scribus~~~1294995303~~~wynne74~~~5~~~Very well done.
scribus~~~1295661743~~~Ehecatl1138~~~4~~~Una alternativa de código abierto que se alza para llegar alto. Si bien aún le falta desarrollo Scribus nos permite familiarizarnos con el mundo de la autoedición de manera simple y con muchas características útilies.
scribus~~~1295721535~~~fcole90~~~5~~~Great! It's like InDesign
scribus~~~1297512265~~~Le_Pat~~~4~~~Good but hard to use for the beginner. Bon logiciel, mais ergonomie perfectible
scribus~~~1298954891~~~orionthehunter~~~5~~~I needed a project at hand to learn it.  Once I had tasks that I wanted to accomplish I realized how intuitive the workflow became.  The properties dialog is where almost everything happens.  After some getting used to it this is an immensely powerful application.

scribus~~~1314722314~~~trollboy~~~4~~~4.5 only because my favourite software list is getting too long! Brilliant at it's job.
scribus~~~1317297981~~~Examiner~~~5~~~Even as a Linux newbie - I love it! For some unknown reason, Open Office will not read any of my PDF files. They all pull up as though they are corrupted, even though they are viewable with the Document Viewer. Scribus swooped in to save the day, and have been able to recreate files that are essential to our small enterprise. The user interface is easy on the eyes, and it is not very difficult to figure out how to use all of its many applications. It does, emphasis on does, need a manual added to the Help section. That would make it just about perfect. Very easy to add fonts, very easy to alter image sizes, very easy to reposition text or images...
scribus~~~1317633269~~~linux1492~~~3~~~I was looking for a greeting card software like MS-Publisher from the old days. Scribus looks nice editing program. Gonna use it later for other applications then greeting cards. Perhaps one could do a poster with it. ...
scribus~~~1318527044~~~stleon~~~5~~~Smth like Dreamviewer
scribus~~~1318970061~~~sgbeal~~~4~~~Sometimes it's a bit slow but it can do damned near anything. It strongly prefers a very fast machine.

seabios~~~1314563969~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~nice
seahorse~~~1272469128~~~Alexio~~~4~~~It integrates with Nautilus, gedit and Evolution for encryption, decryption and other operations.
seahorse~~~1288600833~~~kip-~~~5~~~greate encryption tool.. i love it! in fact you can sign any file in system..not only crypt or decrypt.. or you can use it with emails.. briliant!
seahorse~~~1310187204~~~MestreLion~~~5~~~Really powerful! At first, I thought this was only a tool to manage Gnome's passwords... but you can actually do SO much more... create and edit SSH keys, OpenPGP keys (using GPG), Publsh to key servers, and even add a picture to your key! SO good! (and it gets better if you use the seahorse-plugins companion for nautilus)
seahorse-plugins~~~1288600895~~~kip-~~~5~~~i highly recomended !
seahorse-plugins~~~1310189770~~~MestreLion~~~5~~~Necessary for integration with Nautilus (you can Encrypt/Decrypt/Sign files using right-click!) Just remember to REBOOT for integration with Nautilus work! (maybe LOGOUT will do it)
seamonkey~~~1268075691~~~ddalley~~~4~~~SeaMonkey is the modernized Netscape 7.2 suite of Internet programs, including a browser, HTML editor and mail. Ver 2.x has greatly improved the browser (it still has some issues with some sites, but works when others don't), the HTML editor (KompoZer is also related) is still very useful, but I don't use the e-mail or other clients anymore.
seamonkey~~~1274684883~~~afterburner~~~5~~~very nice internet suite
seamonkey~~~1275501369~~~huntman~~~4~~~nice
seamonkey~~~1279213968~~~caverdan~~~5~~~Must have!! The Seamonkey Composer is the easiest and best WYSIWYG HTML composer there is. I use it daily.
seamonkey~~~1279249630~~~Fuzzi99~~~1~~~it's just Mozilla 1.3 reborn, face it, it sucks.
seamonkey~~~1280528370~~~colej84~~~3~~~good browser

seamonkey~~~1286445641~~~tamoghna4~~~2~~~Useless!
seamonkey~~~1287114475~~~a2d2~~~4~~~...every day in peppermint, other linux os? and win7 ...its fastest mail client
seamonkey~~~1288980716~~~Elisa~~~2~~~I used and tested seamoneky enough long that I can say - it might be good just for 'easy' browsing, supporting many add-ons like firefox (FF) but some add-ons which work perfect in FF do not wotk in Seamonkey! E.g. tor button :-((( Do not install tor button in Seamoneky ! All will get to s... :-( You can use tor in seamonkey but must set tor settings manually or by mm3 switch add-on. Torbutton for FF works only in FF ;-)
seamonkey~~~1295715020~~~nicu~~~2~~~Not a good alternative to Chromium or Firefox ...
seamonkey~~~1300223717~~~Tuhin~~~5~~~Nice!
seamonkey~~~1300225718~~~wanda~~~2~~~Out off the time.
seamonkey~~~1304365703~~~Xyie~~~4~~~I enjoy using this. You can also just pick the components of the suite that you want, but if you prefer a suite over standalone programs, this is the browser package you're looking for.
seamonkey~~~1314330785~~~glubbar~~~5~~~I've been using it for quite some time now. It is somewhat superior to its little bro(w)ther FireFox. More robust anyway.
seamonkey~~~1314993462~~~CHuLoYo~~~5~~~I like it, all integrated internet services.
seamonkey~~~1315740493~~~rcagle~~~3~~~Although it works better in windows version, it kept disappearing from Linit Linux without any messages. Decided to uninstall.
seamonkey-browser~~~1304365546~~~Xyie~~~5~~~This is a very nice browser with the nostalgic feel of Netscape, and the power of Mozilla. It functions alone or fits well into a suite of software. Recommended if you like Firefox but want a browser suite rather than a standalone program. (And get just the parts of the suite you want!)
seamonkey-browser~~~1310742268~~~galen~~~4~~~superior coding over firefox, less bugs, less of a hog, less bloat. lacks good themes
seamonkey-chatzilla~~~1304365612~~~Xyie~~~4~~~A fairly decent IRC client. It works better as this standalone program than as an add-in for Firefox, in my opinion.

sensors-applet~~~1296534630~~~MestreLion~~~5~~~By far the best sensor/temperature/monitoring gnome applet ive found. Detected 11 sensors out-of-the-box (4 voltage, 4 fans, 3 temps). GUI is powerful, flexible and very intuitive. Can customize icon, low/high and label for EACH sensor... great!
sensors-applet~~~1296538010~~~jajodo~~~4~~~Pretty good.  Was a bit tricky to get up and running on my setup.  Once configured it is the best linux temp/sensor monitor

sensors-applet~~~1307426652~~~danbarrese~~~4~~~Helpful.  It says my nVidia GPU is overheating at 65 C, although nVidia X Server Settings says 65C is just above idle temperature.  I'm not sure which is correct.

shotwell~~~1271190542~~~Alexio~~~4~~~It can be used to publish photos to Facebook, Flickr and Picasa Web Albums.
shotwell~~~1276876788~~~gozer~~~4~~~Great replacement for F-Spot. Already does 90% of what I need and works well with facebook/picasa uploads.
shotwell~~~1276897444~~~cdup~~~5~~~simple à utiliser, importe sans dupliquer les photos, trouve les photos dans mon appareil, pour le moment fait 90% de ce dont j'ai besoin, et pour les 10% restant, je crois que çà va venir bientot

shotwell~~~1280757759~~~mlsmith~~~5~~~The best photo manager for Linux! Trust me, I've tried them all. It is lacking some functionality but what it does do it does it extremely well.
shotwell~~~1282804346~~~French~~~4~~~Shotwell(Versie 0.5.0)seems to replace f-spot (Maverick Meerkat wich is the base for Linux-Mint Julia) Shotwell 0.7.0 is the Version running at Maverick Meerkat
shotwell~~~1286033522~~~Copyleft~~~5~~~Linux needs more quality software like this. I use OS X, and this is very much like iPhoto; a brilliant Mac-only application. Great to see something like this for free on Linux!

shotwell~~~1291509710~~~sonic4spuds~~~4~~~This isn't as good for browsing fotos if you have a large collection, but is much faster than F-Spot for most things.
shotwell~~~1293117753~~~UncleNinja~~~5~~~Waaaaay better than F-Spot. Mono free!
shotwell~~~1294354896~~~hexram~~~5~~~My favorite photo organizer for Gnome

shotwell~~~1295197801~~~tommed~~~4~~~much better at handling large photo collections than FSpot
shotwell~~~1296358551~~~killmess~~~3~~~Better than F-spot but I prefer Geeqie for a viewer and picasa as a simple, easy and fast editor. I DON'T like programs that organize things without my consentment.
shotwell~~~1296406364~~~jflarm~~~5~~~Maneja muy bien las fotos, ordenandolas por fecha y etiquetas
shotwell~~~1297216348~~~cmaew04~~~4~~~I like it so much better than f-spot. However I am not a big fan of programs that move and organize things for me. I am fickle and they never organize them the way I want them too.

simdock~~~1296533892~~~Xyie~~~2~~~Appearance is good, but functionality seems troublesome. Settings don't seem to persist (like added launchers or changes to background) upon application restart. Only displays on one desktop in gnome. It's got some good potential as it looks wonderful for not needing compiz or 3d acceleration, but function over form, I say.

Ich hoffe, die deutsche Version wird bald in das Repositorium seinen Einzug finden. Windows-Nutzer können die deutsche Version verwenden, hier also lieber eventuell die Windows-Fassung laden und mit WINE arbeiten.
singularity~~~1282593398~~~blackbird80~~~4~~~a great game with a nice interface, it remembers me the good old amiga times (it's something of Oil Imperium). it takes a bit to learn the game mechanics, but when you get the point, it is fun to play.

skype~~~1277199818~~~kage~~~4~~~I agree please include the packages in the iso
skype~~~1277482489~~~jperez~~~5~~~I disagree to adding this to the ISO.  More bloat and bigger filesize.  Review: Great software that does what it's supposed to and does it well.  Call quality, depending on connection and mics being used, can range from subpar to perfect.

skype~~~1279460532~~~Persona~~~4~~~The program works great and is the service skype offers is top notch.

skype~~~1280856731~~~Abd3l~~~5~~~Very nice, great for webcam and mic chat, i love the effects and how it can run in the background.
skype~~~1280952041~~~rahamohebbi~~~4~~~Good application, but Linux version always has been behind compared to Windows/OSX
skype~~~1280990982~~~Leechmaster~~~3~~~Proprietary protocol... fuuuuuuu :(
skype~~~1281456607~~~Dejmon~~~4~~~Ale jo, ujde to.
skype~~~1281545688~~~donald_duck~~~2~~~Proprio... lent.. politiquement incorrecte
skype~~~1281550819~~~miguelavm84~~~5~~~fantastico, pero por favor queremos una interfaz mejorada.
skype~~~1281796727~~~prodrigu~~~5~~~works perfect!
skype~~~1281845999~~~waka_choko~~~5~~~If your camera is not working use this (bash -c 'export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l2convert.so; skype')
skype~~~1281851148~~~dbpatankar~~~2~~~Not free... :( ..... free as in freedom
skype~~~1281871934~~~Janni~~~5~~~As good as it gets
skype~~~1282072216~~~vprokopyuk~~~5~~~Excellent and very useful application
skype~~~1282343691~~~ebula~~~4~~~Funktioniert sehr gut! Hat allerdings keine eigene Möglichkeit, die Webcam einzustellen.
skype~~~1282413969~~~incogita~~~4~~~The gold standard in internet telephony. Fully featured and with a significant user base, which of course increases it's value.
skype~~~1282424839~~~Thraxy~~~5~~~Love it. In fact, I like this one better than the Windows version.
skype~~~1282464858~~~Jinryu~~~2~~~kinda useful for calls because of the great rates, and it has great sound quality comparead to other VOIP services.  Terrible webcam support though, and it lacks the majority of features of it's windows and mac counterparts, like plug-ins and add-ons.  For calls, you're better off using the landline-dialable Skype number (which you can setup on their site) and for IM, there are less clunky protocols out there.  Skype is notorious for dropping IM (not just in the Linux version)
skype~~~1282762853~~~blbec007~~~4~~~No alternative
skype~~~1282934341~~~XeroXer~~~5~~~works great
skype~~~1283331113~~~ludovdk~~~5~~~the best choice
skype~~~1283865196~~~linux1492~~~5~~~A most to have! Skype is connecting people and is a powerful visual communication tool. If one is using it the right way one can make a great benefit out of it and for no fees included. However, some services are indeed not free of charge but they are worse the money. If you don't have it and use it try it.
skype~~~1283948744~~~shwany~~~5~~~excellent
skype~~~1283967196~~~tobacco~~~4~~~Standart !
skype~~~1283970436~~~CBindahouse~~~3~~~I had to search the internet in order to find out why my webcam wasn't working, but got there eventually! So everything seems fine, and no ads! Woop!

skype~~~1286589140~~~m4daredsun~~~3~~~Skype is great but this 2.1 beta version is definitely outdated
skype~~~1286630949~~~lollo6_83~~~4~~~works fine, but PLEASE release an official version! This beta is there from years!
skype~~~1286922763~~~frankeinstein~~~4~~~I always use skype, and I do like it but we really do need a new version.
skype~~~1286988945~~~funky2010~~~5~~~Mind Blowing!!!
skype~~~1287067579~~~Angtagapagligt~~~5~~~Skype is just great! Works very well!
skype~~~1287333926~~~PinkSombrero~~~5~~~Does its job well. Allows me to conference call without any problems and stuff, but the linux version is still quite a bit behind the windows one, making chat + call situations a pain. However, I still really, really, really like it.
skype~~~1287478811~~~mentos001~~~4~~~it does the job quite well (the main purpose) but it's sad to see the differece in treatement between the 2 versions win and linux, please post your desagreement here http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=709513&st=0&gopid=3108213&#e;ntry3108213;

skype~~~1288605210~~~punkrtekk~~~2~~~I have it because not as many people use Ekiga:-( Also you can see that developers work more on Windows version, so many people with linux have problems with their webcams (though mostly it can be sorted by starting skype from console and using v4l1).)
skype~~~1289063048~~~Anutesyn~~~4~~~Useful program!
skype~~~1289213720~~~Ringhio~~~5~~~Great software, now with video capabilities it's even more complete

skype~~~1294301524~~~Doruletz~~~5~~~Great. Finally a working voice/video chat for Linux. Wish there was also an MS Live Mess and Yahoo Mess equivalent, so that I can kiss Mr. Gates goodbye, or rather adios... once and for all.

skype~~~1296847171~~~marshcast~~~2~~~Derogatory to a healthy way of living. Using it because I have no option - others are on skype but it's not poss to call them on any other software. unhealthy and makes me angry. May it open up or Die. (Oh! aren't I the happy bunny!)
skype~~~1297081315~~~quaie~~~5~~~mic doesn't work on a sony vaio vpcf136fm mint 10 x64; except this, all is ok, including video

skype~~~1297549326~~~pazoff~~~3~~~Needs improvement to get to the windows version functionality.
skype~~~1297592429~~~mudslinger~~~5~~~I like it
skype~~~1298116022~~~MestreLion~~~4~~~Skype is vital, and im SO glad we have an official linux version from repos. Interface looks very outdated, but it does have all the main features (Webcam, Chat, SMS, SkypeOut, 3-way-conferences, etc). I loved the clean, spartan interface (i hate the bloated windows one). Too bad is not open source. At least the interface could be.
skype~~~1298119076~~~systemgrafica~~~5~~~Indispensable
skype~~~1298291333~~~Rodpaulo~~~4~~~Simplesmente o melhor
skype~~~1298306732~~~guv999~~~4~~~I have found this easy to use and configure on Mint and it has some nice features, I have not used the windows version for some years so cannot confirm any missing features in the Linux version

skype~~~1300930943~~~elopio21~~~5~~~Muy Bueno!
skype~~~1300970189~~~Koffeehaus~~~5~~~can't wait for the day where it actually stops being a beta and becomes a full-fledged app on in its own. What I noticed is that rythmbox is hogging my sound devices and when it's on skype isn't working properly. If you have the same thing make sure you kill rythmbox. Also you can post your problem at forum.skype.com - lots of Linux users there :)
skype~~~1301082751~~~edtheuniquegeek~~~5~~~Love it. Works great with Logitech C500 but doesn't recognize Logitech USB headset.

skype~~~1302557725~~~Homitsu~~~4~~~I don't like it, but everyone goes Skype, so, no way to use alternatives... Technically OK.
skype~~~1302633273~~~roguededguy~~~5~~~The best cross-platform video chat application there is. Those who don't like it, probably don't like anything proprietary or with added features that cost money. The software works and it works well.
skype~~~1302796759~~~headshott99~~~5~~~Greetings from Bulgaria,Peter Rundev :)

skype~~~1303334973~~~DynamicMan~~~3~~~Unfortunately Skype does not prioritize their linux client very much at all, which is noticeable when compared to the MS Windows version. Still a very functional and useful application, even if it is closed source.

skype~~~1308238471~~~chi_julia~~~3~~~Skype is all right on linux, but its performance could be better (and it would be nice to be out of beta sometime!).  I use it if I have to, but I'd much prefer to see an open-source or free alternative someday.

skype~~~1310254650~~~CyberAly~~~3~~~The Mac version is laid out much better than this, in my opinion. This version doesn't make it clear enough when you're recieved a message, plus, it's just plain ugly. Maybe I should use WINE and use the Windows version of Skype?

skype~~~1317405272~~~imhotep~~~2~~~The 64 bit version has a memory leak. Yo have to kill it and then restart it again. The 32 bit version is stable. The user interface is worce that on Windows. And don't forget Microsoft owns Skype - so  I don't expect any support for the linux world. So - let's move to EKIGA

skype~~~1320077157~~~Karunamon~~~4~~~A bit behind the windows client (so some of the newer whiz-bang stuff won't work), but don't let the FOSS zealots scare you away. Skype is still awesome.
skype~~~1320207224~~~sayem_bd~~~3~~~Far behind windows client. Don't know how it's performance will be in case of video/audio chat, I  have only used it for text chat.

slingshot~~~1290840414~~~Xyie~~~5~~~I love how this game teaches you a little bit about gravity while it focuses on a two-player "missile shooter" game. (Compare to some 2-D tank games.) The game runs smoothly, doesn't require fancy graphic drivers, and has very nice textures. None of it looks unfinished in any way, and it's a little addictive.

songbird~~~1294956068~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~About Songbird's Linux support... apparently there is unofficial support coming from somewhere. I see version 1.8.0 on getdeb.net's repositories, which is nearly up-to-date with the current Windows version (only one version behind).
songbird~~~1274983055~~~huntman~~~4~~~I like this

songbird~~~1278308032~~~baffle-boy~~~1~~~they dropped any further linux support even though the combined linux users were more than the mac users... and they did a lot more translations. that's just stupid why provide a chart that contradicts what your doing.
songbird~~~1278685077~~~71KR117~~~3~~~This app is nice, but they dropped linux support.
songbird~~~1278801727~~~Twiguard~~~3~~~A good iTunes clone. I did a piece of Czech Translation. =) Unfortunatelly too slow on my netbook. =( Latest version here: skyzim.com/songbird-1-7-3-installer

It may still work on Linux for now, but I have moved on to Audacious and I have not looked back. Was a good program-- I people who do not mind that it is not supported should try it out.

soundconverter~~~1296136064~~~Inoki~~~4~~~The only thing I dislike about it is when you insert multiple files or a folder it doesn't convert them immediately and crashes. You have to even so do everything one by one. Also, when trying to convert multiple files it drains the CPU heavily and my machine ain't a weak one. Other than that, function-wise, nothing on earth can beat this. All you need is all you got right with this package. :)

subtitleeditor~~~1308475624~~~Qruqs~~~1~~~Don't EVER expect it to work like NORMAL translation software! If you "reverse" the two translation files inside the program (like you can do in other softwares), ALL your manual editing WILL be lost in the translated file when you save! Thanks a lot for deleting 540 translated lines of text with absolutely no warning! It also doesn't work glueing two parts together and have the timing work. You need an external editor to glue the parts, and only then let this software adjust line numbers (provided you work with srt files).

supertux~~~1271323760~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~Meine Freundin kann dieses Jump'n'Run stundenlang spielen. Es muß am guten alten Tux liegen. Die Nachahmung SMC zum guten alten Mario, das ist bei ihr nur verpöhnt. Wer es ausdauernd genug spielt, ja, es gibt Geheimwege, etc, aber sie sind oftmals schwieriger als beim Original zu finden. Die Anzahl an Welten ist auch gestiegen, lediglich die Musik hat keine Ohrwurmqualität.

swell-foop~~~1286220873~~~Xyie~~~1~~~This seems to be a complete remake of the GNOME game "Same," only with functionality removed. Quite simply, it looked better before it was replaced in gnome-games. What used to be one of my favorite GNOME games is junk in this version. Undo moves, the scoreboard...can't use those anymore. Even the themes are gone. Did I mention it that it just crashed while I was writing this?

thunderbird~~~1271346330~~~Rufus~~~4~~~Upgraded from Thunderbird 2 to 3 yesterday. Upgrade is not easy for inexperienced users since there is no debian package. Took me a while to figure out how to import my mail folder. Nonetheless, I recommend Thunderbird 3 because it brings my IMAP and POP3 inboxes together into one single box.
thunderbird~~~1273159514~~~Obsi~~~5~~~The change from version 2 to version 3 is really amazing. Really easy to use - it makes writing e-mails even more enjoyable :)

thunderbird~~~1277315682~~~Newbii~~~5~~~Sensationell. Trotz kleiner Schwächen - z.B. immer noch keine Möglichkeiten Privateinträge in die Visitenkarte vorzunehmen - ein tolles E-Mail-Programm, das Outlook überflüssig macht. Danke!!!
thunderbird~~~1277459378~~~Cannadoux~~~5~~~3.1? :-)
thunderbird~~~1277530727~~~thebrix~~~5~~~Faster and more relevant to the home user than Evolution - no 'enterprise' features. Perfect for netbooks - everything fits and much of the UI can be hidden where needed

thunderbird~~~1278008693~~~Adidi~~~4~~~Avec Firetray...

thunderbird~~~1278943640~~~aljoriz~~~3~~~Gmail? this even downloads the spam folder... not a good idea
thunderbird~~~1279097412~~~Liszt~~~4~~~I find it a good 'outlook for Linux'
thunderbird~~~1279226631~~~inhuman_4~~~4~~~This is a great email client for linux. I find it very handy for using with my many email accounts. Plugins allow it to sync with google calendar and google contacts making it even more useful.
thunderbird~~~1286857042~~~Fuzzi99~~~1~~~like all mozilla apps it's going downhill with the memory hogging
thunderbird~~~1279300340~~~sploopidy~~~2~~~I don't really like it, mainly because of its confusing UI.
thunderbird~~~1279377468~~~dick~~~4~~~Just a tad better than Evolution
thunderbird~~~1280009049~~~lewah~~~5~~~La version 3 comporte des fonctionnalités génialissimes !
thunderbird~~~1280622918~~~brianji03~~~4~~~It is great and well organized but I find it easier to just go to a website and check my e-mail.

thunderbird~~~1281867786~~~horro~~~4~~~Used it many years. Lost somehow it's grip lately. Switched to evolution.
thunderbird~~~1282412975~~~incogita~~~3~~~Fully featured, but not anything spectacular. Roughly equal to Outlook, Thunderbird doesn't really bring anything special to the world of Mail cilents.
thunderbird~~~1283200753~~~ekeko~~~4~~~I have no problems using it, but calendar plugin is missing in new version.
thunderbird~~~1283897265~~~mdowden~~~5~~~This has been my favorite email client for some time, but the latest version is even better!  Super-easy to use.
thunderbird~~~1283907276~~~aibo~~~4~~~Great for maintaining years of emails and moving it from box to box
thunderbird~~~1283973058~~~tamoghna4~~~5~~~My default e-mail client. Powerful and easy.
thunderbird~~~1284399686~~~flor_de_azucena~~~5~~~Tried several e-mail clients, but Thunderbird is my favourite. I don't need a Linux version of Outlook; I just want my mail delivered and well organized. Thunderbird does the job nicely.
thunderbird~~~1284409551~~~shwany~~~5~~~does a brilliant job.
thunderbird~~~1284426981~~~ozos~~~5~~~My favorite e-mail client. Easy to use and works great.
thunderbird~~~1284636843~~~dbpatankar~~~3~~~Its good. But can't use PGP without additional plugin(Enigmail). I think this need to be fixed.
thunderbird~~~1284638301~~~linux1492~~~4~~~It's the mail client I choosed to use after plenty of trying. Certainly, there is space for improvements, e.g. import function for appointments from MS-Office Outview. If you are forced to use at work Microsoft software, it would be nice to synchronize some of your data, such as appointments with the clients of different OSs at home.  Since Thunderbird is lightweight and works fine it is a real improvement for people who have a slow/instable internet connection (e.g. mobile internet in Germany). Why then not 'awesome' for Thunderbird? It is not straight forward to set it up to connect to any possible provider. There are thinks to know (e.g. different ports) if you wish to use instead of a google mail account your webmail account from the local provider. It's a jungle and there are no good man pages for Thunderbird on this matter.
thunderbird~~~1284854589~~~emuse~~~5~~~Simply the best email client! Dont use it without Lightning plugin, because that plugin is as good as thunderbird itself.
thunderbird~~~1285022931~~~ceptor~~~5~~~sehr gutes, umfangreiches und gut konfigurierbares email-programm

thunderbird~~~1297027587~~~kip-~~~4~~~good email client... guys check evolution.. its better.
thunderbird~~~1288738642~~~30ctsparer~~~5~~~Nice and easy email client. To have a calendar included, install the "Lightning" addon!
thunderbird~~~1288947992~~~jesica~~~2~~~dont use it that much
thunderbird~~~1288968334~~~shimi~~~5~~~Best mail client I have seen. Really smart, detecting everything automatically, warnings about insecure servers
thunderbird~~~1320381698~~~jage~~~1~~~The new "no brain" automatic settings for accounts have totally fubard my mail, wrecked entire accounts because you can't switch to POP or leave messages on server.  Spam recognition is junk.
thunderbird~~~1289507220~~~tristan~~~5~~~Still use it ever since it came out. Easy and still fast.
thunderbird~~~1289912004~~~Theologian~~~1~~~Another non-essential: my standard, free email has all these features.
thunderbird~~~1289932598~~~anandkumar44~~~5~~~Best mail client simply superb
thunderbird~~~1289962615~~~H4x0r18~~~5~~~Best mail and news client I have ever used! I absolutely love Mozilla.
thunderbird~~~1311154336~~~jessy~~~5~~~Simply very good.
thunderbird~~~1290229761~~~ravi~~~4~~~Good!!!
thunderbird~~~1290229896~~~cogsmos~~~4~~~Reminds me of the days when Eudora was actually good. A must have for anyone still using pop or imap.
thunderbird~~~1290405850~~~killmess~~~5~~~Essential.
thunderbird~~~1290539444~~~l1qu1d~~~4~~~They need to finish intergrading lighting calendar! Doesn't work with my schools exchange server!
thunderbird~~~1290716563~~~Pppoet~~~4~~~Powerful mail manager.
thunderbird~~~1291289750~~~nicu96~~~5~~~best for email
thunderbird~~~1291368452~~~nienarodzony~~~5~~~Klient bardzo dobry ale i tak u?ywam tego wbudowanego w operze :)
thunderbird~~~1292190261~~~tomdiana~~~4~~~Does the job nicely
thunderbird~~~1292193228~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~There are a lot of things I like about Thunderbird. If there's one thing I really miss in it, that's better profile management. Making it easier to migrate a profile to another location/directory/partition would make it pretty close to perfect for me. :)
thunderbird~~~1292323975~~~oi_antz~~~5~~~Excellent client, there's no better email client in the world! (AFAIK). @kneekoo, just copy the /home/[user]/.thunderbird/profiles/[random_id].default/ folder to the same location on your new computer, edit /home/[user]/.thunderbird/profiles.ini on the new computer and change Path=[random_id].default to the correct name of the folder you copied across. That's pretty easy if you ask me, compare that to trying to show the quick-launch in Windoze 7, or any other seemingly simple task for that matter ;)
thunderbird~~~1292345694~~~wanda~~~2~~~Ich gebrauche nur Gmail inclusief mein POP3 mail habe gleichseitig ein excelente spamfilter und alle meine beilege wirden gescant auf virussen.
thunderbird~~~1292759364~~~Inkit~~~4~~~A very good tool to manage your mail if you have two or more accounts all in the same place. Even easier to configure than MS Outlook.
thunderbird~~~1292902507~~~jahwarrior4179~~~5~~~Might I suggest the Lightning Plugin for you calender needs.  After trying others, this is my favorite one yet!!!
thunderbird~~~1293145974~~~necromantiarian~~~5~~~cool + with minimize to tray plugin you can be always connected, and not be bothered by its presence on the panel
thunderbird~~~1293316752~~~romanybob~~~4~~~Simple to use and configure, fast too :)
thunderbird~~~1293627726~~~mm-iv~~~5~~~??????, ??????, ???????...
thunderbird~~~1293748414~~~RobinJ~~~5~~~It's a great e-mail client and it detected my e-mail settings right from te first time. All i had to fill in was my e-mail address and it found all nessecary data on it's own! Evolution is more user friendly in my opinion, but for a little more experienced computer users ThunderBird is great!
thunderbird~~~1293821820~~~nickoff~~~5~~~must have
thunderbird~~~1293865890~~~akash211~~~5~~~I love it and its addons.
thunderbird~~~1294149244~~~Penumbra~~~3~~~Too bloated.
thunderbird~~~1294438692~~~RubenMH~~~5~~~i love thunderbird. and i use it
thunderbird~~~1294615129~~~grim~~~4~~~Pretty good, if you use this kind of software!
thunderbird~~~1295027876~~~infoteamlegnano~~~4~~~forse il migliore della categoria - magari più leggerino...
thunderbird~~~1295176845~~~cybertriveni~~~5~~~gr8!!!
thunderbird~~~1295266201~~~L0r3nz0~~~5~~~It should be the default email client!
thunderbird~~~1296138952~~~efthialex~~~5~~~?????? ???????!
thunderbird~~~1295293913~~~Qruqs~~~1~~~Over bloated junk with M$ Outlook envy.
thunderbird~~~1310818301~~~burjans~~~5~~~The best
thunderbird~~~1295478147~~~nicu~~~2~~~Evolution looks much better than thunderbird
thunderbird~~~1295885818~~~Koffeehaus~~~2~~~I'd rather user Evolution
thunderbird~~~1296540006~~~flan_suse~~~3~~~Thunderbird is fine for an email program, but lacks in some areas.
thunderbird~~~1297216140~~~cmaew04~~~5~~~Personally I like it better than evolution... but I suppose it is all a matter of what you are used to. Whatever floats your boat.
thunderbird~~~1297592525~~~mudslinger~~~5~~~it might be a bit bloaty - but the way it handles all emails and can provide a global inbox to sift through has been an awesome way to keep track of new emails as they come in
thunderbird~~~1297707475~~~bdmegep~~~5~~~Great e-mail client. Lightning extension complements it very well with calendar and task options
thunderbird~~~1298230210~~~maddim~~~4~~~a little complicated lately
thunderbird~~~1298827101~~~Camalus28~~~5~~~Automatically detected my service provider, perfect!
thunderbird~~~1299283423~~~Ioseph~~~5~~~Yet another great Mozilla product.
thunderbird~~~1299892802~~~HATRED~~~5~~~very good for me
thunderbird~~~1300290471~~~Richard~~~4~~~je le préfère à évolution
thunderbird~~~1300536804~~~mspc~~~4~~~very good and using for the last 3 years
thunderbird~~~1300625462~~~danubio26~~~5~~~Great app
thunderbird~~~1300722979~~~coronero~~~5~~~Cel mai bun client de mail.
thunderbird~~~1300735821~~~sonic4spuds~~~5~~~This is the only mial client I can use.
thunderbird~~~1301097146~~~Rikstation~~~2~~~Useful to some, not so good for me
thunderbird~~~1301127795~~~sheldonh~~~5~~~One of the best
thunderbird~~~1301138859~~~aaria5~~~4~~~Top mail software, used it for years, only recently had problems since changing my ISP,  It can't get all the mail off the server. Tried loads of work-arounds to no avail. But still rate this program highly
thunderbird~~~1301179288~~~bugga~~~2~~~I have tried Thunderbird twice now and it has let me down both times by virtue of the fact that it can't import my windows contacts/address book correctly in .csv or .vcf in a simple fashion.
thunderbird~~~1301187478~~~guv999~~~5~~~Great.  Have not used this for a while - far quicker than Evolution and tabs is a cool feature too
thunderbird~~~1301579748~~~Belarus_IRus~~~5~~~Great. but i don't want it in default. gmail is better
thunderbird~~~1302290834~~~bst2~~~5~~~Essential
thunderbird~~~1302819010~~~Elessor~~~5~~~Replaced Outlook without missing a step.
thunderbird~~~1303292237~~~Yuri~~~4~~~Very good program
thunderbird~~~1303977346~~~bAPTIST~~~5~~~The best mail client!
thunderbird~~~1304176631~~~radi1962~~~4~~~my favorite pim (with lightning an other extensions) - very good!!!

thunderbird~~~1304454320~~~gpfwestie~~~4~~~Great outlook express replacement
thunderbird~~~1304604154~~~Aleksandar~~~5~~~U have multiple email accounts that I manage from different compiuters, one on linux the other on win. Really easy to transfer win<=>linux, even all addons and themes stayed! :-)
thunderbird~~~1312063085~~~Germmare~~~5~~~TOP 1 for me: Thunderbird (...with IMAP)
thunderbird~~~1305703477~~~CDEX~~~5~~~EXCELENTE !!!
thunderbird~~~1306154827~~~pazoff~~~5~~~Elegant and functional
thunderbird~~~1306447685~~~AllGamer~~~4~~~a must have, way better than bulky Evolution, this is by far the best email app, unless you need Exchange compatibility, then you are stuck with Evolution
thunderbird~~~1306535775~~~Eagle7~~~5~~~brilliant cross platform mail access
thunderbird~~~1306923069~~~ivopapus~~~5~~~excellent
thunderbird~~~1306947030~~~RytronII~~~5~~~Who needs Outlook Express? Superb email client.
thunderbird~~~1306947554~~~H5N1~~~3~~~function : speed = i do not know
thunderbird~~~1307174516~~~rboroughs~~~3~~~No 64bit support for Calendar plug in! Darn it!
thunderbird~~~1307428111~~~Gurman~~~5~~~Now this is Best email app.
thunderbird~~~1307442477~~~Argent~~~5~~~I have used many email apps.  I prefer this one but there are other good ones too.
thunderbird~~~1307443513~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~1~~~evolution is far better
thunderbird~~~1307736597~~~tristan4536~~~4~~~Like it better than Evolution, but it is a little bit cluttered and can be hard to use.
thunderbird~~~1307746884~~~vkolev~~~1~~~Too slow and with a lot of plugins that make it slower - claws-mail for real mailing.
thunderbird~~~1307754865~~~neko~~~2~~~a monster rather than a bird
thunderbird~~~1312888251~~~chash27~~~4~~~Simplest Email Client !!
thunderbird~~~1308059353~~~pnin~~~2~~~Bloated & slow. I vouch for Claws-mail too.
thunderbird~~~1308066684~~~Paulchenxx~~~4~~~für mail das beste.
thunderbird~~~1308137536~~~kazztan0325~~~5~~~I recommend Gmail users to try this, because it is integrated well with Gmail.
thunderbird~~~1308320463~~~Timmythepirate~~~5~~~The best program for email.
thunderbird~~~1309169164~~~thor480~~~4~~~very good
thunderbird~~~1309249020~~~l7943416~~~5~~~??????????
thunderbird~~~1314113611~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~I like it plus all the themes
thunderbird~~~1309685118~~~trollboy~~~5~~~I used to use Evolution but then I gave this a try. It's very fast but lacks some of the features such as the calendar. The lightning extension isn't compatible with Thunderbird 3 which is a shame. Thunderbird is awesome but I wish there was a 4.5 for the lack of lightning!
thunderbird~~~1309857486~~~samyb2313~~~4~~~Facile à paramétrer, et simple d'utilisation, très "user friendly"
thunderbird~~~1309915581~~~cwoodsp~~~4~~~Easy for a newbie (like me) to use, attractive front-end, and has all the features I require. Overall an excellent, well-thought out package. Now for version 5!
thunderbird~~~1310005973~~~Tannn3r~~~5~~~Very organized and easy to use.
thunderbird~~~1310320034~~~lourdchien~~~5~~~Very easy to configure. Use it with the Lightning extension!
thunderbird~~~1310725446~~~linuxnpl~~~5~~~5*
thunderbird~~~1310979142~~~OnesimusUnbound~~~5~~~Good for offline storage of gmail emails. Easy to set up.
thunderbird~~~1311409940~~~grymskaft~~~1~~~It only handles mails and nothing more, and it sux at that....
thunderbird~~~1311856220~~~yamm~~~1~~~primitive
thunderbird~~~1311870146~~~jingpohu~~~5~~~The best
thunderbird~~~1311875854~~~sigurd1701~~~5~~~Awesome install: just give mail-address and password anything else is automatic. Never ever to struggle with credentials or even server details!
thunderbird~~~1311939944~~~RavS~~~5~~~I think it is quite great Email client (though haven't used others much). But I am more comfortable using Webmail.
thunderbird~~~1312606082~~~Hannes_Hochreiner~~~4~~~Does what I need, but could slimmer.
thunderbird~~~1313040254~~~giuvara-alex~~~5~~~is the best mail client!
thunderbird~~~1313115338~~~Labby~~~2~~~I tried using it, but for some reason it kept putting duplicate copies of all my emails in my inbox. Also, it seemed a bit cluttered. I'm not a fan!
thunderbird~~~1313184047~~~kvant~~~5~~~??????
thunderbird~~~1313190001~~~jvbuxte~~~5~~~This is quite gold standard
thunderbird~~~1314527636~~~Warlock~~~5~~~like it and easy to use.
thunderbird~~~1314618300~~~tecknomage~~~5~~~A sure winner against MS Office Outlook or Express, esspecially the multi-account in one session
thunderbird~~~1314644219~~~mmskywalker~~~5~~~A must-have in all OS.
thunderbird~~~1314734934~~~Tonya~~~5~~~Excellent mail client!
thunderbird~~~1314798966~~~bsnux~~~4~~~Very good e-mail client with a lot of features. Easy to customizate
thunderbird~~~1315203685~~~rpisharody~~~2~~~Used to love it when it came out. Got bloated, slow and unstable. Now back with Seamonkey.
thunderbird~~~1316043274~~~hanif~~~5~~~Very good email client... Sogo Connector and Lightning ext save my day.
thunderbird~~~1316027816~~~Rafson~~~5~~~Probably the best mail client ! I used it also on windows and mac, now I'm waiting for honeycomb version :>>>
thunderbird~~~1316182602~~~kalsan~~~5~~~Great software
thunderbird~~~1316428967~~~Lasse74~~~5~~~Simply great!
thunderbird~~~1316663312~~~notyourbuddy~~~5~~~By far the easiest to setup e-mail client.  Only complaint is you have to manually add a "minimize-to-tray" addon (but thankfully thats easy to do).
thunderbird~~~1317000696~~~Anleoje~~~5~~~Great app ;)
thunderbird~~~1317299660~~~mparfitt~~~4~~~Great, but I have no use for offline mail anymore.
thunderbird~~~1317657869~~~augusto_mint~~~5~~~Great application! I use it in every operating system I use. Is very easy to setup and to maintain.
thunderbird~~~1318486837~~~Samnu~~~5~~~????????!
thunderbird~~~1318674639~~~stleon~~~5~~~For professionals
thunderbird~~~1319800299~~~luxy~~~2~~~I prefer kmail.
thunderbird~~~1319838505~~~Rob83~~~5~~~A must have but you will need to add the update channel of the repository for the newest version.
thunderbird~~~1319935682~~~W4RP1G~~~5~~~Great program, works with Gmail without a hitch.  Very professional.
thunderbird~~~1320425618~~~chassum~~~4~~~Personally, I really like the new "no brain" automatic settings. Much easier to setup my exchange account at work.
thunderbird~~~1320920474~~~FrenchHope~~~5~~~Can't live without it.
thunderbird~~~1322050859~~~Simeon~~~5~~~I do not need anything else.
thunderbird~~~1322227198~~~joez~~~1~~~Too much work to switch from Evolution
thunderbird-locale-cs~~~1307682448~~~Dejmon~~~5~~~Nejlepší e-mail software!

tidy~~~1290605395~~~Elisa~~~5~~~Good
tidy-doc~~~1314396997~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~quite nice
tiemu~~~1296689646~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Emulates the calculators wonderfully, provided you have the ti roms. These can be downloaded from TI's site. Alternatively, you can use the free roms provided. No new menu entry was created for this program, however, and it must be started from the command line, or a manual menu entry must be made.
tightvncserver~~~1280076378~~~pepo84~~~5~~~Eine gute Alternative zu Vino.
tightvncserver~~~1296292268~~~andjelko~~~5~~~It is simple and it works !

timer-applet~~~1294599020~~~Koffeehaus~~~3~~~How do you use it? I have installed it, but I have no idea how to start it.
timer-applet~~~1298156704~~~Xyie~~~5~~~Simple to use straight from the panel for reminders, pops up subtle notification when its finished that's quick to spot but not interfering with whatever you're working on. Great for reminders like checking the oven!
timer-applet~~~1300804393~~~Charamei~~~4~~~For everyone wondering how to use this, you need to restart GNOME before you can add it to a panel
timer-applet~~~1307092972~~~H5N1~~~4~~~Simple to straight from the panel for reminders.
timer-applet~~~1312116196~~~RavS~~~4~~~Useful! But can be improved.
timer-applet~~~1315999600~~~Diogo_Almeida~~~3~~~Could have an option to count time up, besides the countdown feature. Nevertheless, does what it does very well, with a nice interface.
timer-applet~~~1320697361~~~cirx~~~5~~~Small, nice, fun to have
timidity~~~1287538221~~~Xyie~~~5~~~Finding this midi sequencer made my day. I'd previously given up on trying to get MIDI files to play under linux, but this allows them to work!
timidity~~~1294946059~~~grim~~~4~~~Really helped me out with TuxGuitar sound problems!
timidity~~~1298724246~~~Inoki~~~1~~~Comes without a GUI, how is one supposed to maintain playback?
timidity~~~1304337242~~~princeinflorida~~~4~~~Very good sound.  In the midi file Properties I Add the OpenWith command:  "xterm -e timidity"
timidity~~~1320284522~~~smbot31~~~5~~~Makes it possible to play MIDI files... what else can you ask for?

tmw~~~1271323615~~~captainhaggy~~~3~~~TMW ist ein MMORPG, für das es verschiedene freie Server gibt. Die Anzahl der Spieler ist gering, so wie die Anzahl der Abenteuer, die man erleben kann. Auch das Wirtschaftsmodell an sich ist in sich nicht stimmig. Für eine kurze Zeit der Unterhaltung reicht es, man sollte es jedoch nicht mit Zezenia, Ethernal Lands oder World of Warcraft vergleichen. TMW ist zur Zeit eher eine Studie als ein Spiel.

tomboy~~~1275391726~~~dorylinux~~~1~~~...usa mono, per carità!
tomboy~~~1275704813~~~linuxmint~~~2~~~For me, it's useless :(.
tomboy~~~1276908891~~~aneurysm1985~~~5~~~As an ex-Windows user who would constantly have an MS notepad window open to type down quick notes, Tomboy is the perfect tool to do that...and more. I really like the way notes are automatically saved with each keystroke, and the way notes are grouped into different categories. In Linux Mint 7, Tomboy was automatically next to the MintMenu button, but now in Mint 9 it is hidden in the applications list. I wonder how many would-be users are now missing out on this great application :(
tomboy~~~1277694902~~~SeventhReign~~~2~~~It works, but Gnotes is the exact same thing only faster and uses less memory .. sooo
tomboy~~~1278333683~~~galen~~~4~~~syncs whereas gnotes does not. heavy memory and uses mono. syncs to flashdrive then to your other computers, great for multi computer uses who want their notes. Dear low review twits: know how use it before displaying your ignornance
tomboy~~~1279138143~~~sploopidy~~~1~~~It takes up lots of memory, and whats the point? We have gedit.
tomboy~~~1279314149~~~dckjnsn~~~5~~~only drawback is i cannot create links...just copy them
tomboy~~~1280482544~~~Jac978~~~4~~~I like it so much
tomboy~~~1281969460~~~flor_de_azucena~~~5~~~Turned up useful for me. Just notes, nothing more. And always at hand, near the menu.
tomboy~~~1288216645~~~tomdiana~~~5~~~Great!
tomboy~~~1294137191~~~wanda~~~1~~~Gedit reicht fuer mich personlich, und kein mono.
tomboy~~~1293752450~~~RobinJ~~~3~~~It's a nice little program, but it has crashed quite some times in the past few hours...
tomboy~~~1294136862~~~telewatho~~~4~~~Does everything you need it to do, and stores notes in a clever way. Brilliant app.  NEEDS TO BE MORE LIGHT-WEIGHT THOUGH
tomboy~~~1294611159~~~Valthar~~~1~~~Just use Gnote, less of a hog
tomboy~~~1297870893~~~Twix2247~~~4~~~This probably the most used program I have.  I am always jotting something down to remember in a note pad.  This works much better and you can create note books for like items and link notes to other notes.  One of the best products (besides the GUI) to come from GNOME.
tomboy~~~1297904924~~~Rodpaulo~~~5~~~Muito bom
tomboy~~~1301660980~~~jesterofalltrades~~~3~~~This is a great program, but it relies on mono, which is from .NET, which is Microsoft's attempt to weasel into Linux and then cry copyright. No thanks--I'll stick with mono-less gnote.
tomboy~~~1303955697~~~kjuergen~~~2~~~gnote needs less resources and doesn't need M$ endangered crap. Gone together with F-spot....
tomboy~~~1304195782~~~akanashiro~~~2~~~Oh no, I use Gnote
tomboy~~~1304195972~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Not too bad, even though I'm yet finding a niche for a note-taking application in my computer use. Tried it out for re-typing notes for class definitions, and ended up with something with which I can connect information to previous entries for review.
tomboy~~~1304243058~~~xalexx~~~1~~~who use this?
tomboy~~~1305488582~~~trollboy~~~2~~~It's actually not a bad program. If only it wasn't written using Mono
tomboy~~~1306447345~~~AllGamer~~~2~~~useless gedit is way faster for quick notes, that is easily transportable to another device or PC
tomboy~~~1308519388~~~UncleNinja~~~1~~~mono
tomboy~~~1310101263~~~kazztan0325~~~5~~~It is very useful. Especially to use with cairo-dock's applet.
tomboy~~~1310421136~~~tamoghna4~~~3~~~not that bad, it could be useful.

tomcat6~~~1295651457~~~desertviper00~~~5~~~Tomcat is so popular because most of the commercial vendors fill their app servers with bloatware

topshelf~~~1289559449~~~paulasimoes~~~5~~~Great tool to help you found files you are working at the moment
topshelf~~~1298158682~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Useful, but not very configurable. Maintains a low profile on the panel, but compensated with a large window that appears when you click the icon. Don't expect a menu out of this applet, nor a settings manager.

torcs~~~1271073473~~~Alexio~~~4~~~A beautiful 3D auto race game for the serious race fan, TORCS even lets you program your own cars, robot opponents, and race tracks as well.

torcs~~~1307818424~~~creation~~~3~~~Good for now...
torcs~~~1312486146~~~trollboy~~~4~~~To call the computer controlled drones AI is to insult those working on real AI. The cars will be at this point on the track, at this speed pointing in this direction at this time. Should one of the computer controlled cars brush against you with the force of a butterfly, your car will go into a spin, yet it would take a nuclear bomb to make the computer cars deviate from their path. The graphics do convery a good sense of movement but I am usure of the physics as all the cars seem to accelerate at nearly the sme rate, have an identical top speed, except for the obviously slow cars. I should hate it. And yet it's fun. Why is that?
tork~~~1288956065~~~Elisa~~~5~~~I like it due it's really comfortable app but unfortunately I have to say - the configuration is sometimes - especially for newbies - a pain :O :( Why there is NO any tutor/how-to in this comunity tutors page ? :-| [*] Good (but still not best) tutorial is here: http://www.anonymityanywhere.com/tork/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogsection&id=7&Itemid=54

totem~~~1281851413~~~dbpatankar~~~4~~~I like it. Different forward and reverse step in seeking is really very very useful.

totem~~~1283098467~~~mopsas~~~5~~~very good player. i watch my videos, dvds etc. it does what it has to do. vlc has a lot advanced options and i like it much too. it great that there are so good players on linux.

totem~~~1292370579~~~Shostako~~~4~~~Good and easy to use media player.
totem~~~1292391040~~~tacoz~~~5~~~It amazes me that VLC is so over rated... it uses more CPU cycles and RAM than mplayer. For my stuff, i.e. watching movies... this does it perfectly!
totem~~~1293561680~~~fobenavi~~~2~~~Trouble with some videos, so easy
totem~~~1295354659~~~DIONISIS_POLITIS~~~3~~~generally good, but it doesnot load the subtitles automatically, and when manually done it starts from the begining. I prefer vlc.

totem~~~1296031121~~~efthialex~~~5~~~I'm satisfied!

totem~~~1299915439~~~k273~~~2~~~Problems with subtitles.
totem~~~1303419472~~~groovydaddy~~~3~~~Simple app.  Good GUI.  Supports many types of media.  Does not have EQ or other features I would like to see.  I use VLC for almost all of my multimedia (music, movies, etc).
totem~~~1306572682~~~Dannie~~~5~~~Works really good. I have not had any problems playing my videos or music files in totem, or with subtitles.
totem~~~1306680708~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~1~~~there are far better players out there
totem~~~1307130155~~~SamHoratio~~~4~~~Movie Player (Totem Movie Player) is simple, very stable and reliable. It is ideal for playing video and audio files individually and in simple playlists. For more flexibility, such as accurate seeking through a video file or any other manipulation, I'd rather look for other apps. It is disappointing to learn that when moving around in a vidoe file, the duration of skipping through varies depending on the file format (avi, wmv...).
totem~~~1307130644~~~menta1789~~~5~~~ES SINCIYO Y FACIL DE UTILISAR Y MUY BUENO
totem~~~1307265167~~~RavS~~~4~~~Use it as a backup player for VLC. Like its clean interface. Good but can be better.

transmission~~~1300382170~~~tamoghna4~~~3~~~For symple download purpose, it's fine. People are looking for more, should try Vuze.
transmission~~~1305224728~~~Tonya~~~5~~~Transmission was pre-installed on my HD mediaplayer PopcornHour C200,  worked fine. Was also used successfully on Isadora. And now will be tried on Mint 11.
transmission~~~1303369584~~~Fastraxx~~~5~~~Very easy to use and enable features such as require encryption, blocklists and automatic updates.

transmission~~~1314621922~~~MajorGrubert~~~4~~~Jamais eu besoin de chercher autre chose : fait exactement ce qu'il est censé faire
transmission~~~1315389599~~~newpaul~~~5~~~Hilariously straightforward. Stable & powerful (Mint 11). Clean interface, with uncluttered window. All info about each torrent hidden in individual properties window (divided into info/peers/trackers/files/options - which include individual speed and seeding limits). Optional views according to torrent states: all/active/downloading/seeding etc. Offers enabling of internal blocklist (get it from sites such as www.iblocklist.com). By the way, the default .torrent file folder is located in ~/.config/transmission/torrents (open Places>Home Folder and press Ctrl-h to see hidden directories). Very easy to set up. Allows for one-click activation of temporary speed limits.
transmission~~~1315410423~~~henriquemaia~~~5~~~This is the way torrents should be treated. Easy to configure, to understand and operate. Almost Dumb-proof (never underestimate dumbness).

transmission~~~1315943763~~~Rufus~~~4~~~Easy to use, reliable.
transmission~~~1316428899~~~Lasse74~~~3~~~its ok! but compared to utorrent its bad
transmission~~~1316886631~~~mauro_cbc~~~4~~~For those who want just add and download, its works fine.
transmission~~~1317000582~~~Anleoje~~~5~~~For me it's the best bittorrent client in Linux
transmission~~~1317696132~~~standarshy~~~3~~~It's ok, pretty simple and plain, mediocre performance. I think qbittorrent is way better..
transmission~~~1318425997~~~stleon~~~5~~~Works perfect
transmission~~~1318774245~~~liamk101~~~5~~~The best torrent client for linux.
transmission~~~1318887127~~~Chromeronin~~~5~~~Brilliant torrent client, fast, and easy to configure peer block lists, cross patform, so looks just the same in Windows and OS X
transmission~~~1319483579~~~troyM~~~5~~~As a former µTorrent user, I was looking for something that didn't require alot of computer resources, was small, and spyware-free.
transmission~~~1319762989~~~krause~~~3~~~bom mas utorrent e melhor
transmission~~~1319925869~~~linuxsapien~~~4~~~of course I like it, we all like it ;) I just wish I could figure out the daemon stuff...
transmission~~~1319948502~~~ttmrichter~~~4~~~Overall I like this.  Being able to support the "udp://blahblahblah" URLs for trackers, however, would get me to bump it up to five stars.
transmission~~~1322051050~~~Simeon~~~5~~~Torrminator
transmission-gtk~~~1272551665~~~Mioke~~~5~~~transmission's gtk interface is very simple and clean. While some would say that it's too simple and lacks features, overall it's a great, easy to use bittorrent client. If you want a bittorrent client with better organization and/or more features then deluge or vuze may better fit your needs.
transmission-gtk~~~1273168570~~~caje~~~3~~~It just needs more options, kTorrent is much better.
transmission-gtk~~~1273547707~~~sayrink~~~3~~~Not bad
transmission-gtk~~~1273676392~~~nikhilsinha~~~4~~~Simple and Easy to Use.
transmission-gtk~~~1274656410~~~Luigi~~~2~~~seems slower downloading than vuze
transmission-gtk~~~1298193954~~~ReckouNT~~~1~~~shitypitynooby client
transmission-gtk~~~1274701527~~~majortws~~~2~~~I agree with ReckouNT. The first thing I do after install is switch to deluge
transmission-gtk~~~1274946296~~~crondon~~~3~~~Gets the job done, but nothing more. Deluge much preferred here as well.
transmission-gtk~~~1275137749~~~rappelkiste_src~~~5~~~Einfach und rudimentär, aber funktionell.
transmission-gtk~~~1275372313~~~grhdtj~~~5~~~Very intuitive to use and still includes essential options
transmission-gtk~~~1276704643~~~maksordos~~~4~~~????? ??????? ??????
transmission-gtk~~~1277026765~~~crom~~~5~~~I did a little test with Transmission and Deluge and now I have to update my review. Deluge uses much more memory and is complicated with unnecessary options. Down speed was about the same. In the long run Transmission downloaded more.
transmission-gtk~~~1276867336~~~Flaviy~~~3~~~qBittorent much more better
transmission-gtk~~~1278229610~~~mechtician~~~5~~~Best (read; most efficient) bittorrent client for Linux, hands down. Other feature-rich clients like Vuze or Deluge might seem like better solutions, but if you're running an older machine that may or may not have come from the dumpster (like mine, for example) then Transmission is the only way to go.
transmission-gtk~~~1278253866~~~mareser~~~4~~~Simply works.
transmission-gtk~~~1278452164~~~runaway~~~1~~~Ugly , I prefer Ktorrent and Qbittorrent

transmission-gtk~~~1307847721~~~dumsterdave~~~5~~~Great program! Very basic, doesnt have many options, but works great. I found this to be the fastest bittorrent client ive used. Bonus is that it is extremely lightweight

If only Mark Shuttleworth would leave things be. You don't need to fix something that is already good - now its a chimera - not being one thing or the other. I give it one. In Mint it is perfect with Debian and works well with the superb backup team here - Thanks Guys! Your the best!

vim~~~1284469543~~~10basetom~~~5~~~You either love it or you hate it -- I happen to love it! There's a steep learning curve (this shouldn't scare you since you're already using Linux), but once you get the hang of things navigating and editing in Vim is super efficient compared to other editors. Once you become a Vim master, people will see your fingers flying off the keyboard and will get the impression that you're performing some kind of voodoo. I swear the experience can become almost magical.
vim~~~1284828117~~~morfu~~~5~~~I'm to to Vim, feels good for now :).

vim~~~1318865222~~~_skip_~~~5~~~Vim is an extremely powerful editor! Do the tutorials and then use it everyday. You'll come to love the ability to repeat an edit, record and use macros easily, abbreviations, scripting of new actions, and the diff/merge capability. And who doesn't love the ability to highlight keywords/phrases (syntax highlighting). All this wrapped in a quick and functional text editor. What's not to love?!

virtualbox-3.1~~~1276783732~~~Steve_Allen~~~5~~~An absolute life saver when you are forced to use software and drivers that only run in Windoze!!
virtualbox-3.1~~~1276850301~~~acmd~~~5~~~A great app! VirtualBox v3.1.8 (virtualbox-3.1_3.1.8-61349~Ubuntu~lucid) is the best version. Better than v3.2.4 from oracle (sun)!
virtualbox-3.1~~~1277035891~~~selekta77~~~5~~~Perfekt
virtualbox-3.1~~~1277036261~~~SxFlare~~~5~~~Great use, even better with its seamless features. Wish I had the power in this computer to use this for more than just an hour at most.

virtualbox-3.1~~~1278420851~~~RobLoach~~~5~~~Slick.
virtualbox-3.1~~~1278431135~~~Richard~~~5~~~Parfait pour une virtualisation ponctuelle d'un Os !
virtualbox-3.1~~~1278526984~~~linux01~~~3~~~A good piece of software, yes, but they still haven't got around to allowing raw access to local hard drives out-of-box.  This is a fairly basic feature.
virtualbox-3.1~~~1278883382~~~tommy_b~~~4~~~agreed- great fast virualizer but need raw disk access. (but I've got a VM with OS X up on it so I'm not crying too loud.)
virtualbox-3.1~~~1278960597~~~PauLLiK~~~5~~~Awesome! I hope it will be freeware FOREVER!
virtualbox-3.1~~~1279176726~~~quangvuhee~~~5~~~Awesome \m/
virtualbox-3.1~~~1279250492~~~Fuzzi99~~~4~~~The Open-Source version is missing some thing from the paid for version but those always get added in during the next update so all in all the best virtualising software ever (better than WINE).
virtualbox-3.1~~~1279316703~~~hezy~~~4~~~It does the job.
virtualbox-3.1~~~1280115394~~~newchieng~~~5~~~Simple enough to use, good functionality. Useful for having a virtual Windows to run that elusive program and also for trying out distros.

virtualbox-3.1~~~1280427845~~~turin13~~~5~~~Maybe the best VM manager. Must have!
virtualbox-3.1~~~1280629574~~~timloyal~~~4~~~does a good job but could use more features like read from iso.
virtualbox-3.1~~~1280633554~~~Bunstonious~~~5~~~I have been using Virtualbox for about a year, does EVERYTHING i need and more! Number 1 app on all my PC's. Oh, and it ca read from ISO's!
virtualbox-3.1~~~1280655642~~~dbpatankar~~~4~~~Good

virtualbox-3.1~~~1282323851~~~luisbastosrecife~~~4~~~Powerful and free, awesome
virtualbox-3.1~~~1282414125~~~incogita~~~5~~~No VM I've used matches virtualbox in terms of ease of use and usability. Very fast VM and very compatible with a large range of OS's, especially when combined with the Virtualbox guest additions.
virtualbox-3.1~~~1282464672~~~Jinryu~~~4~~~Nice, simple, does the job without much tweaking.  Not as resource efficent as using WINE, but then again, you get a lot more stability out of a virtual machine.
virtualbox-3.1~~~1283085309~~~ribho~~~4~~~like
virtualbox-3.1~~~1283286346~~~ArmandiuxGS~~~5~~~Sin duda, muy rapido y con gran potencial.

virtualbox-3.1~~~1284271900~~~thrillseeker~~~5~~~Incredible! I'm actually running Vista on Linux! And I love the "seemless" mode! It really is seemlessly... The Vista programs look and run just like they normally do in Vista, right there on my Gnome desktop. The only downside is it slows down my system. (I have 2 GB RAM, Intel Centrino Duo, running 64-bit Mint/Ubuntu.) I'd love to try it on a high-end system that could handle it...it seems you'd be able to have the full benefits of both systems simultaneously.
virtualbox-3.1~~~1284399186~~~flor_de_azucena~~~5~~~I absolutely need MS to run... just one program. That's where Virtualbox helps, smooth and fast.
virtualbox-3.1~~~1284767263~~~DiGiTaL-CORE~~~5~~~Im glad its on the list, but 3.2 is now available. Still the best program for almost limitless uses!

virtualbox-3.1~~~1289549497~~~elscripto~~~4~~~Since the very first use of VirtualBox I have forgotten the ancient barbaric times of multi-boot setups.

virtualbox-3.1~~~1293742345~~~gianpv~~~4~~~easy to use and configure, you can test new O.S.
virtualbox-3.1~~~1294385801~~~jcoleman~~~2~~~Tried 4.0 in LMDE "new install" and it didn't load correctly. Locked up Synaptic, searched the forums and nothing worked, probably missed something; 3.2.12 is working good

virtualbox-3.1~~~1303253645~~~groovydaddy~~~4~~~VirtualBox is a really good virtualization app!  Great for trying new distros, running a Windows VM for Windows-specific applications, or messing around with your own Linux distro.  I use VMware mostly because my schoolwork is done with VMware.
virtualbox-3.1~~~1305702347~~~CDEX~~~4~~~Realmente útil y sin las complicaciones de Wine... que sólo es para Wincosas

virtualbox-guest-additions~~~1307033884~~~magicbus~~~5~~~Highly recommended for Virtualbox OSE. It adds special features for setting up the guest system, among other things.
virtualbox-guest-additions~~~1311597519~~~bugz~~~4~~~I think that installation of this package should be triggered by virtual box installation or at least `auto-suggested`.
virtualbox-guest-additions~~~1311941891~~~RavS~~~5~~~Quite necessary if you want to have a full fledged user experience on Virtualbox!

virtualbox-ose~~~1292193975~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~For non-professional environments this is perfect. :) I didn't even feel the need to try anything else than VirtualBox after I discovered it. :)
virtualbox-ose~~~1292669760~~~silentnick~~~5~~~Great virtualization software. Let's you experiment/work in a sandbox environment w/o messing up your running system.
virtualbox-ose~~~1293752230~~~RobinJ~~~5~~~VirtualBox is definately the best Virtual Machine program available! I've tried quite a few of them, but VirtualBox is and will always be the best!

virtualbox-ose~~~1295820431~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Works well. The non-free version (but still cost-free) is even better! Try version 4 - amazing!
virtualbox-ose~~~1297143072~~~zaenal1234~~~5~~~I like this software, because it can execute the 'file exe for 3d (graphic)' with the perfect & better than 'non-free virtualbox'. & to test another OS (: windows or linux or others...). My maxim is: " aquarium in the aquarium ".
virtualbox-ose~~~1297215827~~~cmaew04~~~5~~~Great software! It does not emulate your graphics card (instead it creates its own) so gaming is almost impossible, but there is always wine for gaming.
virtualbox-ose~~~1297382081~~~Flaker~~~5~~~Excellent! Very fast and easy to use. We need version 4 now....

virtualbox-ose~~~1304754151~~~mjoens41~~~3~~~non-free version is much better
virtualbox-ose~~~1304755345~~~trollboy~~~3~~~This is one package where getting the non-free version is very much worth it. Ose is fine if you are trying to run a completely free box.

visual-regexp~~~1292110171~~~kneekoo~~~3~~~I have mixed feelings about this software. It's good in theory but it's interface is not friendly enough. You can't even paste in it. I have no idea why but that doesn't help me. Otherwise it's OK.

vlc~~~1271225600~~~Napster~~~4~~~In my opinion vlc is rare, lightweight but awesome media player. But lacks some library options.
vlc~~~1271318309~~~peramak~~~5~~~must have.
vlc~~~1271370592~~~kneekoo~~~4~~~I like it but I found that versions 1.0.3 and above have a bug that leads to no image at all on certain videos/codecs, although the sound is working. Thank God for the default theme change. The player finally looks complete.

vlc~~~1273006774~~~foxiys~~~5~~~foxiys
vlc~~~1273066790~~~moorewarner~~~5~~~VLC is the champ at playing media files of all kinds, nothing comes close. It doesn't have as many features for managing media, playlists, alblum art/lyrics, and others, but as far as *playing* media it's the only player you will ever need.

vlc~~~1274230105~~~thx1138~~~5~~~Wie unter Windows ist VLC die absolute Nr. 1 der vorinstallierten Progs. Watt die nicht fressen, mach der VLC ;). Naja, solange die abzuspielende Datei fehlerfrei ist, aber das ist ein anderes Thema.

vlc~~~1274544707~~~Kitsune22~~~5~~~I've been using VLC for ages and can say that it is the best movie player available, and not bad for music, either. I wouldn't use anything other then VLC for watching movies, and it is always one of the first things I install on a new OS. The only “buggy” part of it is the skins feature (which I suggested you shy away from), everything else about it is top-notch, and I have no hesitation in saying that VLC is the only movie player you'll ever need.

vlc~~~1288834896~~~orionthehunter~~~4~~~Far better than most media players but it still has room to improve.  The default UI is a bit unattractive (thankfully it is skinnable).  The occasional technical stumble or my expectation that it will play any media file ever made sometimes fails.  Though it will usually at least pull the audio track and play it.

vlc~~~1290718019~~~pasdechance~~~2~~~good...even great...but it is overkill! the average user does not need so many options. i don't personally know that many people that use the transcoding and streaming possibilities included with VLC and other people still that don't even know that they exist. in terms of video playback mplayer and even totem get the job done just fine.

vlc~~~1294709769~~~beyecixramd~~~5~~~Nice!
vlc~~~1294711135~~~JeanGrosJean~~~4~~~Not bad, but I prefer SMPlayer, which play everything as well as VLC and, as a bonus lacking in VLC, does remember where you stopped a file, so you don't have to look for where you quit, SMPlayer does it for you.
vlc~~~1294780307~~~efthialex~~~5~~~Really good
vlc~~~1294872004~~~Qruqs~~~4~~~Lots of good to say about it, but it fails on some codecs MPlayer plays.

vlc~~~1302566879~~~rusofil~~~5~~~Very, very good
vlc~~~1302648742~~~roguededguy~~~4~~~I prefer mplayer for bluray because in between chapters VLC will show the cone icon. Pretty good, as long as you set deinterlacing to automatic with a linear setting to remove the motion blur.

vsftpd~~~1319832536~~~cirx~~~2~~~NOT "simple" for an average Mint user! First thing after installation is messing around with a cryptic error message and googling around for help forums and wondering about more messages from the terminal window. I don't mind to eventually become an expert with the terminal thing, but when I'm looking for something simple I expect more of an intuitive interface.

vuze~~~1282327909~~~nolarut~~~4~~~Impressive and promising but also a bit complicated to use. The claim in the description to having instant access to numerous pieces of info about a torrent is not entirely accurate, imho. I prefer Deluge because my needs do not require a multimedia torrent client.
vuze~~~1284373211~~~ashwinhgtx~~~3~~~Too heavy. But lots of features and it's pretty.

wally~~~1275668258~~~conf~~~3~~~it surely does its job but this thing is way too bloated. Look at the list of dependencies it drags into your system, lots of kde and even the mysql server. For such simple tasks i prefer simple tools like wallpaper-tray.

warsow~~~1271329008~~~woockash~~~4~~~Nice game. Graphics are interesting and playing makes a lot of fun.
warsow~~~1271329326~~~captainhaggy~~~5~~~Wer das Buch "Botjäger" kennt wird an dem Spiel sicherlich doppelte Freude haben, aber die Grafik ist wirklich sehenswert, kostet aber auch ihren Preis, nämlich viel Leistung von einem eher als Spiele-PC gedachten Rechner. Auf dem Netbook ist es nett anzusehen, aber die meistens grafischen Funkionen sind aus- oder auf dein Minimum zu stellen. Der Anspruch des Spiels, die Bedienung, ist viel hochwertiger als z.B. bei Openarena. Wäre nicht der Hardwareheisshunger, hätte es OpenArena bei mir bereits ablösen können zum Actiondaddeln.
warsow~~~1273213536~~~VICTOR360~~~4~~~A Fast Paced First Person Shooter Game  Graphics R Beautiful Something Different
warsow~~~1273958274~~~jkw~~~4~~~Fast free FPS game with advance combat moves. Only downside is that you can't start multiplayergames with your friends without having a server running or picking a public one.
warsow~~~1274115093~~~guitarmaniac~~~5~~~??? ???????????, ?? ???? ?????? ???????
warsow~~~1274532586~~~M4t3us~~~5~~~Another UT clone but with a little twist, the cartoon like graphics. It may not sound like much but to me it was AWESOME!
warsow~~~1275754494~~~DanRock007~~~4~~~cool game, but the sound did not worked well for me
warsow~~~1275850214~~~Rovanion~~~5~~~A direct classic for LAN-parties, if you need to get the adrenaline pumping again: Go Warsow!
warsow~~~1279400066~~~VinsentArgando~~~5~~~cool game
warsow~~~1280599890~~~GiantEnemyCat~~~2~~~For some reason this game supports a crap load of resolutions but not my 1360x768. When I set it to 1024x768 the FPS just dies. Too buggy and it should perform so much better on my i5 750 / HD 5770 / 4GB DDR3 1333MHz system.
warsow~~~1282251941~~~Jac978~~~4~~~I like this game so much. Runs well on my old PC with Geforce5700LE.
warsow~~~1283277597~~~Martinimaster~~~4~~~great game, just a pity noone plays it any more...
warsow~~~1291198382~~~Elisa~~~3~~~No big deal...

warsow~~~1300900868~~~meen~~~3~~~?? ????? ?????? ????...
warsow~~~1306465476~~~angelcleff~~~5~~~i love it! , not the best looking graphics but the look nice, and is really fun to play !
warsow~~~1310246593~~~velja27~~~5~~~Very fun game. I love it, but this is not the newest version... newest is 0.62.
warsow~~~1312132097~~~blueXrider~~~3~~~boring
warsow~~~1315601892~~~Squirrel~~~4~~~This game was really fast paced. It's fun, zany, fast paced, and fast enough for a quick shred game with friends you know. DO NOT install from the software manager, though! Install this from the website, or you cannot play against people who use other distributions!
warsow~~~1316021079~~~linux1492~~~3~~~it kept me for 20 minutes busy and then I lost my interest. Playing it on a netbook is not the kick, I guess ...
warsow~~~1318426237~~~stleon~~~2~~~No fun. Bad game
warzone2100~~~1271079559~~~KittyKatt~~~5~~~Everytime I switch distributions and start looking into installing games again, this is the first game I download. Warzone2100 has always been my favorite RTS. A great game and definitely worth your time.
warzone2100~~~1270989385~~~Roin~~~5~~~I remember playing it on my PS 1 (still have that version here) and it is still the BEST strategy game of all times and the best open source strategy game available!
warzone2100~~~1271118443~~~ArcherSeven~~~5~~~Granted I play it on Arch, but it's awesome as all get out.  Graphics are pretty sweet for a free game too, gotta say.
warzone2100~~~1271219305~~~RedWagon~~~4~~~It's a fun game but has a very steep learning curve.  It's not something you can just jump right into, which kind of hurts the game.  That being said, I was a HUGE fan of Red Alert CNC 1 & 2 but grew away from the franchise with their later games but this game brought me back into RTS's again.
warzone2100~~~1271328435~~~woockash~~~3~~~Not bad game. Maybe not perfect, but the best Open Source RTS.
warzone2100~~~1271357399~~~captainhaggy~~~5~~~Warzone 2100 gab es vor einigen Jahren im Handel zu kaufen, wo es recht erfolgreich war. Das Spiel selber ist überschaubar, für Strategienarren ein Leckerbissen, denn es ist leicht in die falsche Richtung zu laufen .. und nach einigen Missionen Probleme zu haben. Besser. Wenn möglich gerade am Anfang Zeit lassen, sofern man keine "Echtzeit"-Mission hat. Grafik und Auflösung kann sehr weit runter und rauf geschraubt werden.
warzone2100~~~1273857297~~~JAHGoVeg~~~5~~~I LOVE IT!!! Especially the easy click and command method of control. granted there is a lot of work to become good at this game like RedWagon said it is still one of the Best RTS Game i've played
warzone2100~~~1273958347~~~jkw~~~4~~~Worked perfect as a time killer when I didn't have internet access on a total of 6 hours train trip across the country.
warzone2100~~~1274206038~~~huntman~~~5~~~perfect game
warzone2100~~~1274468622~~~mikkh~~~5~~~At last a real RTS for Linux
warzone2100~~~1288426134~~~DanRock007~~~5~~~This is a really good remake of the original, i do even think it's better! This game is pure strategy because you can preisly choose your strategy because of the extremely cool vehicle creator. I managed to get it on my psp too and i am wasting hours playing this!
warzone2100~~~1274545162~~~Kitsune22~~~5~~~This is a awesome game that doesn't get the attention it deserves. I recommend playing one player mode first (to learn the basics), then starting a multiplayer battle game-- as that is really where this game shines. The unit and research customization makes for a different game every time, even if you choose the same map-- and you might, as the maps are all well thought out, and if you don't like them, you can download extra maps from the site. You can also add custom music and even mods that can change the game significantly. A fair warning, however-- games against other players can draw out for hours, so make sure you have time on your hands-- this isn't a “pick up and play” type of game. If your looking for a good RTS and have friends who also are, however, look no more: this is your game.
warzone2100~~~1275901952~~~agnard~~~5~~~a really great game
warzone2100~~~1276473799~~~Sherbet~~~4~~~It's not SC2, but it's a lot of fun!  Best game I've played for Linux so far.
warzone2100~~~1276529935~~~Hfastian~~~2~~~Graphics good, controls satisfactory, but boring gameplay.  I was reminded strongly of StarCraft, only without the fun.
warzone2100~~~1276828307~~~cardinal4~~~3~~~It's very ... difficult to play. Maybe I'm too much of an C&C fan. Might appeal to some people.
warzone2100~~~1278770427~~~elkos~~~5~~~a great RTS
warzone2100~~~1280878955~~~timloyal~~~4~~~it does have a few bugs still that close the window. Overall not bad
warzone2100~~~1280961186~~~Raven95~~~5~~~The Graphics Are A Bit Bad But Once You Get Into The Gameplay You Can Waste Hours Of Time Playing This
warzone2100~~~1282704996~~~unexistance~~~4~~~really awesome game, the only downside is the download size ...
warzone2100~~~1284684176~~~sythe~~~5~~~Fantastic, challenging strategy game. You can switch from a top-down view, to a per-unit view, FYI.
warzone2100~~~1285788706~~~kip-~~~5~~~fantastic :)
warzone2100~~~1287162884~~~jessie0514~~~5~~~It is a very nice game.
warzone2100~~~1287751121~~~strider~~~5~~~A seriously brilliant game. I'm rubbish at these kind of games, but I really enjoy them. Especially the skirmish. It feels like there is no end to the amount of research you can do and new weapons are popping up all the time. There's also some really good maps and brilliant scope for building huge bases and basically taking over the world. The graphics are a little bit old but that is perfect for my old machine, and even if I had a better computer I would still enjoy it as the gameplay and intuitive controls are excellent. And it's free! 5 stars all the way..
warzone2100~~~1289269766~~~Koffeehaus~~~5~~~The game is brilliant! I remember I used to play it on PS1 when I was a kid, but I couldn't finish it. Am intending to do it now. Nostalgia... :P
warzone2100~~~1290544339~~~J-manning~~~5~~~One of the few games that gives you complete control on how you play.
warzone2100~~~1292023188~~~UnixAnt~~~3~~~It's clearly a good game, but the AI really needs some work.  On Easy mode, the CPU will wipe the floor with you after a mere 5 minutes of playing.  Several repetitions of this doesn't really make for an entertaining game.  Overall not bad, but for casual gamers just wanting to kill a couple of hours against the AI, it's just too frustrating...
warzone2100~~~1292167670~~~Sparksman~~~5~~~Played the original back in the old xp days! LIke it!

warzone2100~~~1304109845~~~Cipi~~~4~~~Nice and cool game! Cool and cold. I installed it, played it, is nice, is fine, I like it. Kind of StarCraft...

wesnoth~~~1271072366~~~clem~~~5~~~Very good game.
wesnoth~~~1271079243~~~KittyKatt~~~5~~~Awesome turn-based strategy game with a storyline that's easy to follow.
wesnoth~~~1271357609~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~Wesnoth ist extrem gut spielbar, wenn, ja wenn man sich nicht vor einiger Zeit entschieden hätte eine Kommandozeilenschalter einzubauen, den man erst im Internet ersuchen muß, um das Spiel erfolgreich auf Netbooks spielen zu können. Und da liegt auch der Hund begraben. So schön das Spiel ist, so schlecht ist der Startbildschirm und die Menüführung. Würde man da das Design ändern ... und die --smallgui Schaltung überflüssig machen, bekäme es die volle Punktzahl. Es gibt unter Linux kein Programm, das sich mit der tollen Spielweise messen kann. Hoffentlich überdenkt das die entwickelnde Community bald noch einmal.
wesnoth~~~1271358586~~~kunk~~~4~~~Really enjoyed the game back in the days when I still had time for games.
wesnoth~~~1271585911~~~distrohopper~~~4~~~Pretty good game.
wesnoth~~~1273031963~~~Cole~~~5~~~This is a very addicting, innovative, low requirement strategy game which could easily steal the better part of one's day if there not careful.  If you download... you won't be disappointed!
wesnoth~~~1273068101~~~moorewarner~~~5~~~Wesnoth is a highly polished, expertly crafted, extremely engrossing strategy game. Much like chess; the rules are simple but still lead to endless possibilities. It has great music, a ton of campaigns; this is one of the true gems of FOSS games.
wesnoth~~~1273172842~~~akanashiro~~~5~~~very addictive game, the stories are exciting. there are a lot of new campaigns (add-ons)
wesnoth~~~1273446318~~~Pentarex~~~5~~~Try It and love it.... One of the best turn-based strategy game for linux !!!
wesnoth~~~1273581938~~~afterburner~~~5~~~this is something special
wesnoth~~~1274108692~~~white_~~~5~~~Game that take few hours, days, weeks from my life. One of the best games for Linux.
wesnoth~~~1274390449~~~andre_fernandes~~~5~~~Fantastic, a great game!
wesnoth~~~1274663079~~~araujo~~~5~~~El mejor juego de estrategias. Muy bueno.
wesnoth~~~1274781534~~~huntman~~~5~~~Great game
wesnoth~~~1274782449~~~mamang~~~3~~~no good for netbook with resolution 1024 x 600 refresh 60 hz
wesnoth~~~1275056772~~~jxoesneon~~~5~~~great!!
wesnoth~~~1275385474~~~Aurimas_St~~~5~~~It is a really great game. Everytime I reinstall or try a new linux distro, this game is first thing to download
wesnoth~~~1275957482~~~boballen55~~~5~~~Great turn-based stradegy game.  Also free and open source.
wesnoth~~~1276258571~~~ckoul~~~5~~~Great turn based game!
wesnoth~~~1276368332~~~Sherbet~~~2~~~Didn't work for me in Isadora AMD64.  Buttons were broken.
wesnoth~~~1276371215~~~pirategeorges~~~3~~~I liked the game's story and played a lot, but I feel bored... something have to be better....
wesnoth~~~1276606083~~~HiebammE~~~4~~~Klasse Strategie Spiel !
wesnoth~~~1276872175~~~cardinal4~~~5~~~I'm nt v gd at TBS, but this was really user-friendly! I enjoyed playing thru e dialogue and single player. Must try!
wesnoth~~~1276922163~~~Vincent~~~5~~~This has become one of my favourite open-source games! It's both fun and challenging, and a great, addictive time-killer!
wesnoth~~~1277116726~~~CeleronD~~~5~~~amazing fun
wesnoth~~~1277574485~~~Mbinjavaid~~~5~~~Nice campaigns. A very fun and challenging game.
wesnoth~~~1277694237~~~ohfine~~~4~~~???
wesnoth~~~1277744618~~~onclipevent~~~5~~~Really good game :)  It's my new favourite game for Linux! I'm playing it all the time! Very addictive :D
wesnoth~~~1278765470~~~ElPresidente86~~~5~~~The gameplay is good: easy to learn but hard to master. The atmosphere is well done too. Good game.
wesnoth~~~1286603079~~~Fuzzi99~~~5~~~I love this game, always did since the first beta I found even before I learned that there were different Operating Systems other than Windows 98. but has one downside..... the download size
wesnoth~~~1280401628~~~elscripto~~~4~~~Very good game, although it may get boring due to small vairiance of units per race. The bad: sometimes is irritating to keep 4-5 main heroes from being killed. At expert levels this turns into nightmare. The good: one can easily and legally cheat, when pressed for money, unit parameters or main heroes lives. Just gunzip a saved file, open it into a text editor of your choice and modify the troblesome parameters, then gzip it again and reopen into the game :)
wesnoth~~~1280427790~~~turin13~~~4~~~Not as good, as Heroes of Might and Magic 3, but very descent game. I recommend it.
wesnoth~~~1281722702~~~Jac978~~~5~~~It's the best TBS I've ever played. (2nd Heroes3-WoG)
wesnoth~~~1280928790~~~andym3~~~5~~~Awesome game!
wesnoth~~~1280991040~~~Leechmaster~~~5~~~it's great! Tons of fun!

wesnoth~~~1282593553~~~Raven95~~~4~~~Not As Good As Heroes Of Might And Magic But Still Worth A Play
wesnoth~~~1282867380~~~colej84~~~3~~~ilike it
wesnoth~~~1284041210~~~William_Berzoff~~~3~~~It's a nice game but a bit dated. I like the strategy element. At times it's funny. Graphics are decent and good for slower pc's. Music is very good.
wesnoth~~~1284079401~~~jimmyjazz951~~~5~~~I've been playing this for years.  It's fantastic
wesnoth~~~1284086821~~~yaas~~~2~~~asd
wesnoth~~~1284424867~~~ozos~~~5~~~really great game, It's very funny
wesnoth~~~1284573047~~~linux1492~~~3~~~It's a nice game and one can kill time with it. I won't erase it from my disc but it is not my most favorit game. It is a challenging game and one can find situations for strategical moves. Then again playing the game on a netbook is not the best choice and it is poor that the game is not adjusting to the screen size. ...
wesnoth~~~1284582906~~~jabolmax~~~5~~~fajna gra z urocz? grafik?
wesnoth~~~1285243445~~~Laan~~~5~~~Very good game, i love this kind of game and i found it very intresting and appealing

wesnoth~~~1287833552~~~Miquel_Ubuntero~~~4~~~Nice game. Addictive in single or multiplayer
wesnoth~~~1288123822~~~AirValor~~~5~~~The best fantasy turn-based strategy game on Linux. Period.
wesnoth~~~1288607307~~~punkrtekk~~~5~~~Probably the best native-inux game for linux. But still it far behind Windows games...
wesnoth~~~1289064772~~~boggle~~~5~~~Great game, good on old machines. Turn based gameplay is not for everyone though.
wesnoth~~~1290114485~~~H4x0r18~~~5~~~I love turn based games, this is one of my favorites on Linux.
wesnoth~~~1290387735~~~matiasdeon~~~5~~~El mejor juego!!
wesnoth~~~1290479011~~~FunkyWhale~~~4~~~Good game, but stages take too long for my taste.

wesnoth~~~1294085944~~~leopardox~~~5~~~Best turn based stratagy game ever

wesnoth~~~1295649382~~~Brian_Foxglove~~~5~~~If you've ever played a game like Fire Emblem or Shining Force, this is a lot like them. It's a very well done game with hex tile map system.
wesnoth~~~1296147271~~~Derathor~~~5~~~Really nice and addictive game.
wesnoth~~~1296347345~~~edilsoncr~~~5~~~The best linux game!

wesnoth~~~1299845492~~~cazazo~~~2~~~Not my thing!
wesnoth~~~1299847736~~~OneDragon~~~4~~~It's a pretty cool free game, definitely worth trying out. For me personally it's a bit too simple. There are rather complex elements and some that are just way too simple imo.
wesnoth~~~1299883781~~~dalek~~~5~~~This is so much fun!
wesnoth~~~1300375186~~~Zer0~~~4~~~Decent game.

wesnoth~~~1313636306~~~measlyWeasel~~~5~~~Easily the best game on linux. So addictive it makes it hard to get work done!
wesnoth~~~1315077025~~~Kikito~~~5~~~My favorite so far on Linux. Love the sprite design and the gameplay is challenging, which is good in this day and age of games that are too easy.
wesnoth~~~1316517945~~~Emil89~~~5~~~I love the game.
wesnoth~~~1317199741~~~wtlhk~~~5~~~nice nice
wesnoth~~~1318970628~~~sgbeal~~~4~~~If it wasn't so damned difficult i would love this game.
wesnoth~~~1320277966~~~Rhaley~~~5~~~Addictive
wesnoth~~~1320546468~~~FreeImposter~~~4~~~I don't usually get too into strategy style games, but I keep coming back!

wicd~~~1275119646~~~AndrewX192~~~4~~~Great replacement for NetworkManger, always does the job properly.
wicd~~~1276901380~~~Flaviy~~~5~~~I like it so much!!!! Especially after anguish with  network manager
wicd~~~1302008351~~~jasonjohnwells~~~5~~~wicd worked like a charm when Network Manager, the default wirless app for Mint 10 KDE kept nagging for "secret for.." password prompts with and without kwallet and other forum suggestions.  Also, I thought my video streaming problem was with Flash but no wicd clearned up that god awful buffering situation too.  Thanks for making Linux wifi accessible for newbies like me wicd maintaners.
wicd~~~1306772237~~~Steampunk-Nick~~~3~~~simple and easy to use but i prefer the default network manager
wicd~~~1309210652~~~chi_julia~~~5~~~I had trouble with the default network applet, but wicd fixed my wireless issues.
wicd~~~1313937148~~~mmskywalker~~~5~~~After installing wicd and completely removing network manager my netbook is working wireless !
wicd~~~1315214256~~~tinyCubensis~~~5~~~The default network manager freezed my computer. Wicd is my hero.
wicd-gtk~~~1318017179~~~shabgard~~~5~~~Awesome!! It's my first app to install in every distro i use !
widelands~~~1271323398~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~Ein hervorragender Nachbau von Die Siedler, grafisch jedoch eher an Version 1 als an 2 angelehnt. Wirklich Kampagnen, Missionen wurden bislang nicht erstellt, es fehlt wohl noch an einem ambitionierten Levelbastler, aber der Ansatz des Spieles ist in der Zwischenzeit wirklich sehr weit vorangekommen. Leider gelingt es noch nicht, einen dauerhaft zu fesseln.
widelands~~~1276935309~~~Mad_Mac~~~5~~~Great game! Even greater when playing multiplayer ;).
widelands~~~1277744963~~~onclipevent~~~4~~~Awesome :D Total favourite here!
widelands~~~1280629001~~~timloyal~~~1~~~very bad game. no x on anything when you open a window you cant close it. No instructions worth having.
widelands~~~1288892026~~~LordOfFrost~~~5~~~Exellent. Best RTS ever. Great "Settlers" port.
widelands~~~1290388029~~~Inkit~~~4~~~Overall a good game. May not have too much in terms of graphics, but then hey its still under development and the developers say so right at the begining of the game. A very good game if you are interested in strategy based games, not so good if you are interested in the look and feel as it is still very basic. One thing though, it says 1MB but it is more like a 100 MB download.
widelands~~~1293557712~~~noman2008~~~4~~~not bad.
widelands~~~1294392871~~~pancaran~~~4~~~Very good
widelands~~~1295197238~~~Jac978~~~4~~~If you liked Settlers you will love this as well.
widelands~~~1305825084~~~yusufbolu~~~3~~~it is almost impossible to have enough sources. you can't have Marble because you don't have Wine, but you can't build a wine Winehouse because you don't have Marbel. Wen you have them after hours, hey this time you don't water or something. Developers should make it easier to get resources.
widelands~~~1307441604~~~Argent~~~4~~~Nice Settlers 2 clone
widelands~~~1308988420~~~ugubabba~~~5~~~superb settlers clone with a lot of love.
widelands~~~1309339526~~~grant~~~5~~~Many hours spent playing this. I was a huge fan of Settlers though too. I play this on my Desktop and phone. The Mint version is not the newest though.

window-picker-applet~~~1271319964~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~In meinen Augen ist es besser als das Fenster-Applet. Wenn man nur ein paar Symbole hat, ist das viel übersichtlicher!
window-picker-applet~~~1275802468~~~nivapo~~~4~~~???????? ?????????? ??????, ?????? ??? ???? ??? ????????????????. ???????? ?? ?????.
window-picker-applet~~~1298157258~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Looks like a good tool for customizing Gnome for a small screen. Offers all non-maximized windows as icons for saving space, and uses the rest of the space for a title bar of the maximized window. I think i've seen a suggestion to use this one with "maximus" if I remember the name correctly, so that the window title bar doesnt' take up extra space when maximised, but instead moves to this applet.
window-picker-applet~~~1299587018~~~bensoliman~~~5~~~Great for netbooks.
windowlab~~~1314372840~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~quite nice
wine~~~1272362506~~~clem~~~4~~~Does a good job at running Windows software (some of it anyway) if you ever feel the need..
wine~~~1272860988~~~jackharvest~~~5~~~When used with the tutorials from winehq.org, this is VERY hand stuff. Used with wietricks makes it even more ultimate. 5/5
wine~~~1273065987~~~moorewarner~~~5~~~Wine is a great compatabilty tool for those Windows apps that are still needed. It doesn't run all Windows software but it runs more and more with each release.
wine~~~1273161242~~~Obsi~~~4~~~Really useful for these old Windows games you really want to keep on playing ;)
wine~~~1273176424~~~caje~~~5~~~Linux programs are enough, but I can play Icy Tower so it's cool :P
wine~~~1273202762~~~jatwood~~~4~~~Wine does a pretty good job at running Windows programs when needed.  I would like to see better gaming support so the move to Linux would be complete.
wine~~~1273544206~~~linuxmint~~~4~~~Awesome program for people that need windows programs. Doesn't work with everything but does a pretty good job anyways.
wine~~~1273572422~~~fishwilson~~~4~~~I only use this to run Spotify and it does a good job at doing so.
wine~~~1273857106~~~JAHGoVeg~~~4~~~Awesome at Running those programs that you use to keep a windows computer for. :p
wine~~~1274271785~~~xalibas~~~4~~~Good for simple jobs
wine~~~1274352624~~~Felagund~~~3~~~Version Wine1.2 (available via MintInstall) runs more programs / la version Wine1.2 (disponible via MintInstall) fait tourner plus de programmes.

wine~~~1275551008~~~sojin~~~5~~~A right job done rightly.
wine~~~1275669709~~~yui72o~~~5~~~really great
wine~~~1276447480~~~Verix~~~5~~~Love it. At the very least, it saves you a lot of avoidable reboots into Windows and provides a very lightweight alternative to a VM. Plus, you'd be surprised how many applications run in it!
wine~~~1287764804~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Good tool when it's compatible with something you HAVE to run. I strongly recommend using PlayOnLinux to run install scripts for some programs and to sandbox all your programs into their own prefixes. Keeps things much more sane.
wine~~~1283259111~~~rob0917~~~3~~~helps keep dual booting to a minimum

wine~~~1278736768~~~LinuxWiz83~~~3~~~Very good program and used it off and on but still needs work but has improved a lot over the years
wine~~~1279137344~~~sploopidy~~~4~~~Works with my retail version of Half-Life from 1998, so I'm happy :)
wine~~~1279250638~~~Fuzzi99~~~4~~~missing some compatibility features but that's M$'s fault not WINEHQ's. other than that perfect, I can use Steam and most Steam Games :) (btw WINE Is Not an Emulator)
wine~~~1279542733~~~xpd259~~~4~~~wish it wasn't needed but it fills the gaps
wine~~~1280250965~~~terravoice~~~4~~~It 's practical when it work!!!
wine~~~1280469617~~~Jac978~~~5~~~Once perhaps we can forget this... but in the meantime it's a must have.
wine~~~1280542279~~~Markeh~~~5~~~Great stuff
wine~~~1280601245~~~selekta77~~~4~~~Nicht schlecht!
wine~~~1281036336~~~Sulumar~~~4~~~not bad
wine~~~1281207450~~~Mito~~~4~~~Very useful software
wine~~~1291249892~~~Celtore~~~3~~~While wine does its job, and loads certain windows based software, It is slightly unpredictable about what it will load and what it wont. I would rather find a linux alternative than resort to wine for applications
wine~~~1281270266~~~glaasje~~~5~~~one day i hope that we will never need this and something form windows
wine~~~1281723823~~~denver~~~5~~~=]
wine~~~1282043528~~~ounet~~~5~~~Indispensable pour un passage en douceur de windows à linux
wine~~~1282064184~~~factor-h~~~5~~~More than OSs, people uses applications and only then they use an OS. That is the role of WINE, to free Applications and thus reduce non-OS issues in OS usage. And it does it well!
wine~~~1282148128~~~ivanovnegro~~~3~~~Great that I dont need it anymore.
wine~~~1282150242~~~mocito_feliz~~~4~~~Perfect....but it's better to use Linux apps
wine~~~1282411537~~~incogita~~~2~~~Most programs have complications and many bug when run through Wine; getting programs to work with Wine is almost an art form. This application is impressive, but has a long way to go before being truly useful.
wine~~~1282461385~~~r1j1k~~~3~~~Linux is not another way to run Winapi!
wine~~~1282629949~~~bugz~~~5~~~Good possibility to run favourite programs. If this emulation can't cope then you can always use VirtualBox to run whole OS under your linux
wine~~~1282747374~~~winnerer~~~5~~~It`s cool
wine~~~1283206342~~~Felipe~~~3~~~Es bueno para correr algunas utilidades exclusivas de Windows
wine~~~1283221163~~~linx~~~5~~~It's very useful program, I like it :)
wine~~~1283896864~~~shwany~~~4~~~not bad really, however its always best to find an open source program before you attempt this.
wine~~~1283907396~~~aibo~~~3~~~Always hoping for more than it can deliver.  Usually can manage to get Window$ programs to sort of function, but only after hours of digging through their website and tweaking.  Then only to kill the functionality of the last Window$ program I worked hours to tweak to work under wine.  Wish it worked better.
wine~~~1283920974~~~fanisatt~~~4~~~It is very usefull. I had some nice windows xp games and I use most of them (80%) effectively in Linux Mint with the wine emulator. You can download such free games here : http://www.freegamepick.com. I can also use some very usefull (for me) windows xp midi applications. The most exciting is that I can use some freeware vst instruments with LMMS.
wine~~~1283973244~~~tamoghna4~~~2~~~Don't like it.
wine~~~1284035248~~~arztriper~~~4~~~Sólo lo uso para Spotfy, pero facilita la vida en estos pequeños casos.
wine~~~1284229942~~~hazo~~~5~~~Great for the occasional Windows software you need to use in Linux. Newer versions way better than the older ones.
wine~~~1284399878~~~flor_de_azucena~~~4~~~I use it to run some old Windows games... but I wish I didn't:)
wine~~~1284427123~~~ozos~~~4~~~I use it to run some windows software
wine~~~1284791246~~~nagalman~~~4~~~I think it is great that I can run Windows apps in linux. I think I am at the point where I might be able to switch entirely to Linux...
wine~~~1285974413~~~michal0luczak~~~5~~~HI IF YOU are knew users and You use LINUX but still you need software with Windows this SOFTWARE  ||| W I N E ||| IS FOR YOU
wine~~~1286459899~~~zaenal1234~~~3~~~commonplace.
wine~~~1286740322~~~scorici~~~4~~~Wine helped me to make the complete transition to Linux. No more windose for me. But it can be inpruved.
wine~~~1287334625~~~PinkSombrero~~~5~~~Its kind of sad that it's an essential part to the linux-user's pc, but it does its job and yea. I just hope that one day we wont need it. Oh, but I AM having trouble opening up the virtual C:/ drive browser sometimes for some reason.
wine~~~1287335246~~~waterpump~~~3~~~Running wine under LXDE. Can't access C drive, complex or new windows programs difficult  to run.
wine~~~1287357436~~~mrfox~~~4~~~good
wine~~~1292621640~~~m4daredsun~~~4~~~Wine is great to install and run Windows applications. Not easy to use though
wine~~~1287764348~~~Caspar~~~5~~~Running MS Office just fine here - Just click setup and install as you would using Windows! Also have a couple of Windows games running smoothly here. Wine is doing a terrific job!

wine~~~1297207494~~~bartekxx12~~~5~~~Like others say, a must have :)
wine~~~1297215704~~~cmaew04~~~4~~~It is a must have for Linux. The only reason it misses a few points is because it might be really hard to use for  complete noobs. More often than not you need to install other software to make the programs work. This is not easy for noobs.
wine~~~1297905186~~~renatohalfway~~~5~~~+

wine~~~1306457367~~~linuxelf~~~4~~~There are still a few apps that don't have Linux counterparts.  Wine bridges that gap admirably.
wine~~~1306522722~~~debianadicto~~~3~~~Esta version es algo vieja ya... las mas recientes logran hacer correr muchas mas aplicaciones, ademas, deberia venir wine con el .net framework ya instalado, si no hay que instalarlo desde consola (por eso quizas a alguno no le corra casi nada)

wine~~~1310559850~~~trollboy~~~4~~~I have mixed feelings about Wine. On one hand, I can play the 10+ year old Windows games that I used to love but on the other hand, I'm still running some Windows software. I think I have to say that I like it purely for the ability to play things like Hardwar and Privateer 2: The Darkening.

wine~~~1311134895~~~Laff~~~5~~~Wine is simply a must-have on linux! It would be great if mint were to include it on the install dvds, might attract some windows first-time linux followers.
wine~~~1311181191~~~tristan4536~~~1~~~Do not use this software! It slows down your computer and is impossible to uninstall.

It gets to the opening screen and crashes the entire Linux Mint 11, even if Wine is set for virtual window. I just wish it had better support for games, none of my games work even when WineHQ says it will.

wine1.0~~~1301761797~~~ildrago1974~~~5~~~great!!!
wine1.0~~~1311339552~~~maheshbhoir~~~4~~~Metatrader 4 works fine with this version. I can see crossshair in white color only with this version.
wine1.0-dev~~~1314372813~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~quite nice
wine1.0-gecko~~~1314372803~~~blueXrider~~~4~~~quite nice
wine1.2~~~1271586846~~~distrohopper~~~5~~~Doesn't always run apps at full speed, but it's pretty much the best tool for the job.
wine1.2~~~1273309102~~~Xtigyro~~~3~~~nice app but it should be bettered a lot to be fully functional and working
wine1.2~~~1273957744~~~jkw~~~5~~~I use it to play World of Warcraft. Works great. Only downside is the poor support for Direct3D. But I rather blame the game developers for not making the graphics in OpenGL.
wine1.2~~~1273980522~~~3picide~~~4~~~By no means does it replace running 99% of apps in Windows, but it's good for the odd program that has no Linux/GNU alternative. Namely: it's for playing World of Warcraft.
wine1.2~~~1274016359~~~huntman~~~5~~~nice app and works perfectly
wine1.2~~~1274352409~~~Felagund~~~4~~~This Beta runs much more programs than the basic one / cette version fait tourner beaucoup plus de programmes que celle de base.
wine1.2~~~1274388620~~~IOTA368~~~5~~~Very good, I can use a lot of paid soft for win I have and that do not exist for linux. Best and based on wine: Cross-Over!
wine1.2~~~1274779066~~~UncleSpanky~~~5~~~One of the best programs avaliable for Linux and a must for playing Windows games
wine1.2~~~1275251354~~~crivote~~~4~~~A nice addition to linux, for switchers that can't find an alternative to their favourite windows piece of software
wine1.2~~~1275702330~~~superstargoddess~~~3~~~Expect to get horrible frame rates with this and a good (but not the most high end) graphics card in World of Warcraft.  At least I am able to get the correct resolution and able to change the settings.  But I don't know if this is going to be playable while doing dungeons or not.  Low fps was on a single target in combat in an uncrowded area and I had 9fps.
wine1.2~~~1276034603~~~Rovanion~~~5~~~If you wish to run an application in wine, drop by winehq.com and search for your application. It will tell you if it works or not, or what you must do to get it working.
wine1.2~~~1276619704~~~Heyron~~~5~~~ual!!!
wine1.2~~~1277032940~~~Mbinjavaid~~~5~~~It's the only reason I don't dual boot Windows with Linux. It should run many Windows programs flawlessly. For a database of the the apps that can run under Wine, check out the Wine AppDB online.
wine1.2~~~1277127226~~~riseabove~~~4~~~works perfect with the small programs i have tried
wine1.2~~~1277132143~~~mikefreeman~~~3~~~Wish that it ran more software and up to my system's graphic potential. The few programs I can get to work run very slowly. Sadly it doesn't run .NET 3, 3.5, or 4, which eliminates many of the programs out there.
wine1.2~~~1278196640~~~linuxmint~~~4~~~Works with some programs, not all. Other than that, it's a great piece of software.

wine1.2~~~1289366391~~~ajmoser3~~~2~~~I could not get wine to load any windows softwar except for e-Sword which did not function though it was loaded. Thanks keep trying to make it simpler for poor non geeks like me.e.

wine1.2~~~1295646437~~~Brian_Foxglove~~~5~~~It works very well, much better than I expected. Although it isn't perfect, nobody who ever uses Windows software shoudl be without Wine.
wine1.2~~~1297286339~~~jjolumahe~~~4~~~excelente prugrama
wine1.2~~~1298856475~~~pravin_chahande~~~1~~~Didn't work for me.
wine1.2~~~1303504499~~~groovydaddy~~~4~~~WINE doesn't work for all Windows programs, but it works with many of the ones that I've had to use for school.  Can either set up WINE as an emulator in its own window, or set it up to emulate windowed programs.  Very useful.
wine1.2~~~1305401492~~~bossmm~~~5~~~great with some apps
wine1.2~~~1305621298~~~jeremi360~~~5~~~From version 3.x I can put Window$ in trash :)

wine1.2~~~1307544990~~~kad3t~~~4~~~it does not work with all the software i'd like it to work with so that i could abandon windows altogether but it's fine enough and keeps majority of programs in at the very least usable state :)
wine1.2~~~1308146404~~~gwaro~~~3~~~i have tried it on mint 11 but it doesnt work.it had worked on julia but for katya i get a message tha the programs are not marked as executable bit.anyone help please

wings3d~~~1301599356~~~jeton~~~4~~~very good
wings3d~~~1304541575~~~easy~~~5~~~Excellent modelling application. You can use it along with Blender, the modelling part is much easier in Wings. It has great selectors, also very good UV mapper. Perfect for organic modelling, but also very good for modelling vehicles, buildings, etc. I'd recommend it for other game developers! It certainly has a great potential.
wings3d~~~1309863261~~~angelcleff~~~5~~~Love it!, powerful, easy to use, simple, easy to learn, a really must have tool for fast 3d modelling, i think its like the 3d mypaint, and blender is the gimp. Highly recommended!

wordgrinder~~~1272515435~~~Mioke~~~5~~~A very simple and easy to use word processor. It doesn't get in your way with fancy buttons and unneeded menus. In fact wordgrinder only contains one menu that is brought up with the escape key. If you often find yourself distracted by other things when you're trying to write something than wordgrinder may be for you. Just start it up in a console and start grinding.
wordgrinder~~~1290366325~~~m00d1e~~~5~~~Brilliant!  The only terminal-based text editor designed especially for writers.  Vim, Emacs and Nano are all great, but they're designed for programmers.

wormux~~~1271323233~~~captainhaggy~~~4~~~Ein wundervoller Worms-Clone, die Benutzerführung wirkt in meinen Augen manchmal etwas hakelig, aber der Suchtfaktor des Originals ist durchaus erhalten geblieben. Die Anzahl an Karten und Waffen ist angenehm, hat man doch so einen recht langen Spielspaß.
wormux~~~1271328845~~~woockash~~~2~~~Everything is ok, excepting the most importang thing in such a game.... physics. When you hit the character he flies like a peace of wood. There is no fun with such a stupid behaviour.
wormux~~~1273281536~~~kwahoo~~~4~~~suUper!!
wormux~~~1274228792~~~PortAClown~~~3~~~It will be a cool worm replacement- when developed

wormux~~~1286817988~~~multibaba~~~4~~~Cool
wormux~~~1290086290~~~AlkoLoiK~~~4~~~Not as good as Worms, but Wormux has a good potential!...
wormux~~~1290888309~~~Koffeehaus~~~3~~~I like this game, but i remember, when I was using Sabayon, there was a CPU opponent option. The LinuxMint's one doesn't seem to have that; which, for me makes the game impractical. Is there a chance of upstreaming the game from Sabayon Linux?
wormux~~~1295198591~~~Jac978~~~4~~~I like it.

xaralx~~~1295088202~~~Qruqs~~~5~~~Very nice vector graphics editor, with a huge amount of features, one of which is its memory handling, awesome! On the down side: pretty steep learning curve, if you're used to Inkscape, IMO.

xaralx~~~1307429563~~~Gurman~~~5~~~Very good vector editor. Best vector editor for webgraphics IMHO.

xchat~~~1283790188~~~ron_o~~~5~~~XChat is an awesome IRC client. You can control just about everything about the look with it (through "text events"), which you can't with many other IRC clients. The only thing it can't do is run in a terminal.
xchat~~~1284332502~~~MathiusQuest~~~5~~~Best there is for me. Love it to bits!

xchat~~~1311876050~~~sigurd1701~~~2~~~have no use for it. use pidgin an empathy
xchat~~~1311941240~~~RavS~~~4~~~Quite great! But should only be used by hardcore IRC users. Casual users are better off using Pidgin instead.
xchat~~~1313200438~~~Labby~~~4~~~Easy to use and gets the job done!
xchat~~~1314214760~~~Warlock~~~5~~~Easy to use and it's simple
xchat~~~1315410522~~~henriquemaia~~~5~~~If only IRC was that easy to operate when it was all the rage. Still, xchat is the best option for all the hardcore fans of this protocol that want to communicate and spend less time tweaking it.
xchat~~~1320860592~~~cirx~~~5~~~"If only irc was that easy to operate when it was all the rage." you name it. ah, the memories. well it is not TOO easy nowadays. I like it, works from the start thanks to default autoconnect to some linuxmint-supportchannel :)
xchat~~~1322091834~~~linuxsapien~~~5~~~AmIRC was the core of all excellence when it came to IRC. This is why Xchat is based upon that exact client. This has made my IRC sessions still a joy to use now that I am apart from my Amiga. I just wish it was updated more often, ive given plenty ideas! :D
xchat-gnome~~~1278606337~~~chernobit~~~3~~~Perhaps the best graphical IRC client for Mint, even though it lacks some things to be perfect.
xchat-gnome~~~1282584163~~~Xyie~~~2~~~All the basic settings I wanted to change were inaccessible in this last time I used it, and while apparently still available by editing gconf, were inaccessible to me as a basic, general user. In fact, the default settings I found very annoying and frustratingly hard to change. I thought XChat wasn't the client for me until I tried regular xchat. I'll have to review this again to see if it's changed since last time I used it.
xchat-gnome~~~1283948538~~~adirusf~~~2~~~too simple xchat is more useful
xchat-gnome~~~1291388247~~~sarhan~~~1~~~it sucks !
xchat-gnome~~~1291389578~~~wanda~~~3~~~Nicht schlecht aber weniger einstel moglichkeiten.

xchm~~~1299388302~~~singh_gurjeet~~~4~~~The fonts were not the same as in HTML, but still very useful. I am now using kchmviewer
xchm~~~1312264663~~~chash27~~~4~~~now no need to go for windows to see chm file. cooool!
xchm~~~1311765113~~~mustafa678~~~4~~~the best chm viewer in gnome
xchm~~~1316644245~~~fooquit~~~4~~~xCHM can search across all pages whereas CHMSee can only search in the current. CHMSee tends to render thing better and has a more attractive UI but the utility of full text search makes xCHM the better of the two IMHO

xfburn~~~1277516079~~~aia832003~~~4~~~Light burning application with all the basics. Brasero is good when it works and Xfburn has a similar look and feel without the unpredictability.

xfce4~~~1307815526~~~menta1789~~~5~~~ESTA PADRE SE INSTALA EN POCOS MINUTOS Y ES LIGERO Y LABERDAD PUES NO ESTA MU PADRE COMO OTROS ENTORNOS LIGEROS COMO LXDE
xfce4~~~1309981845~~~trollboy~~~5~~~This was always my number 2 after Gnome; but since Gnome 3 / Shell, it's my number 1! Slap on Compiz, Emerald and Mint Menu and it's as slick as Gnome ever was
xfce4~~~1312287425~~~bikrus~~~5~~~Lightweight. Fast. Customizable. With "stable" interface.
xfce4~~~1314225383~~~rijnsma~~~5~~~It's fast and it works great. Gnome3 has first to improve much and for the time being Xfce could be (after some adapting and learning) a fantastic alternative..!
xfce4~~~1317357551~~~cooleric1234~~~5~~~After finally getting it all configured works better than gnome2. Faster, better weather app, less extraneous junk.

xfe~~~1272473995~~~Alexio~~~4~~~The fastest graphical file manager I can find.
xfe~~~1295268940~~~murmelbaer~~~4~~~XFE - I got the hint from linuxUSER 02.2011 (Germany). A very good graphical file manager with a lot of possibilities: Integrated Image viewer >X File Image< and mediaplayer >Audacious<. You can start it with root privileges. Fast and easy to use.
xfe~~~1314553124~~~dodies~~~5~~~Dopo qualche uso e configurazione può essere un valido sostituto di Krusader per chi, come me, cerca una valida alternativa per non dover installare tutte le dipendenze di kde. Completo di funzioni e decisamente leggero.

xiphos~~~1273875459~~~Ulfasti~~~4~~~Very good program to study Bible and ancient languages. May crash sometimes, so 4/5!
xiphos~~~1314558107~~~beta_tester~~~5~~~Briliant BIble study program, has never crashed here :)
xiphos~~~1279134126~~~adzik~~~5~~~Excellent, in depth Bible study application. Native for Gnome environment. Responsive, stable and well thought out.
xiphos~~~1281159390~~~Xyie~~~4~~~The interface takes a little getting used to but it makes it easy to do so. The compact layout doesn't get in your way but it's fully functional. Lots of modules to choose from, and easy to get them! I've not even tried all the features yet and I like it.
xiphos~~~1281163686~~~mikefreeman~~~4~~~Great Bible program. I only wish the "proprietary" Bibles (NIV, Message, etc.) would come out with compatible modules. Makes it hard to quote verses from when people are expecting certain popular versions.
xiphos~~~1283684983~~~excentrica~~~5~~~Easy to use, Reliable and Free!
xiphos~~~1284256580~~~davidwpoe~~~4~~~Although it lacks the search features and original language modules in commerical programs, this is the best Bible program for Linux and has plenty of basic features to help with the study of scripture.
xiphos~~~1284771192~~~anguyita~~~5~~~adelante!!! pode ser mejor que el e-sword
xiphos~~~1288813117~~~jesica~~~5~~~this is very very handy
xiphos~~~1289262883~~~pietronno86~~~4~~~but there is the new version: 3.1.4..
xiphos~~~1290933923~~~Elisa~~~2~~~No big deal...
xiphos~~~1293827451~~~ArgusVision~~~5~~~I have used this tool regularly for years. (Including the privious version 'Gnome Sword'.) It has helped me research verses, commentary, etc. for many messages for my youth group.
xiphos~~~1300553659~~~chupt~~~4~~~Gracias ,saludos desde Chile
xiphos~~~1309898602~~~RevDieter~~~5~~~It is impossible to compare Xiphos to the commercial bible software I need to run in a VirtualBox, but for the quick reference it is awesome. I'd like to see tools to convert resources from my commercial programs into sword format. I actually prefer the Xiphos experience over BibleTime - but that is, as I said elsewhere, just a matter of taste...
xiphos~~~1318803022~~~Silverknight~~~4~~~Needs more translations such as NKJV and AMP
xiphos~~~1322059273~~~chassum~~~4~~~Worthy alternative to BibleTime. The repository manager is actually better than the one on BibleTime.
xiphos~~~1322257811~~~marco76~~~5~~~Briljant! In het Nederlands is de statenvertaling + kanttekeningen beschikbaar. Verder veel extra's zoals bijv. de verklaring van Matthew Henry.

I use a script to render earth as a projection superimposed with recent cloud cover data and a day/night filter to make an interesting desktop background.
xplanet~~~1307888054~~~sajukktheeternal~~~1~~~FFS. Another command line tool, that needs a phd in nuclear physics to run. It could at least function with some defaults enabled. I don't have a week to study it thanks, I'll run an earth screensaver instead. I believe it's time the programs changed philosophy. Really

xsane~~~1298423532~~~Xyie~~~4~~~Xsane opened up more features for my scanjet scanner. Simple scan worked well, but wouldn't offer to scan negatives or slides - two features of this scanjet scanner. Xsane not only offered those features, but also had features reminescint of the features that the HP software offered for scanning. If you want to want to use your scanner's full features, or are having trouble with scans using simple scan, try xsane.

Once you add a site to allow scripts and/or plugins it saves it to the whitelist so you only have to do it once. The only downside is on sites that have a lot of scripts from multiple sites it is sometimes difficult to know which sites to allow for the site to display correctly and which ones are ads or potential malicious scripts and/or plugins. This is where Google comes into play to research ads and malicious scripts from scripts you want to allow for the page to display correctly and function as intended.
